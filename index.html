			 <p>I came across a fantastic article today from <a href="https://austinkleon.com/newsletter/">Austin Kleon’s weekly newsletter</a> that he wrote called <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2021/07/13/the-pirate-gardener/">“The pirate gardener”</a>. It’s worth reading in full.</p>
<p>In it, he shares that Brian Eno suggests that artists can be divided into either farmers or cowboys. Then Dave Hickey gave a different spin on the same idea, classifying people as either farmers or pirates.</p>
<p>Austin challenged the idea that we can define people by those categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This got me wondering, as I often do, about nouns and verbs. Maybe it isn’t a question of being a farmer or a pirate, but whether you’re farming or pirating. Maybe they’re two different artistic modes that we operate under.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This made me think of a corollary in software engineering. Projects can be classified as either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project">greenfield</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development)">brownfield</a>. Often, software engineers have a strong preference one way or the other, and shape their careers accordingly. But that is not who they are.</p>
<p>It is interesting to think about how much our preferences define us. We attach labels to ourselves, and to others, that we call our “identity.” I’m leery of reducing anyone to a single part of their life. People are complex beings. We need to acknowledge that in ourselves and recognize that in others.</p>

			 <p>The words we speak or the tone we use can cause damage just as physical blows.</p>
<p><em>Originally posted on my <a href="https://world.hey.com/bennorris/verbal-violence-64c393ff">HEY World blog</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>This evening I had a small altercation with my eight year old. It was nothing major. He refused to do his chores when it was clear that he wouldn’t get his turn on the Nintendo Switch since it was already bed time. He slammed the door and ran downstairs.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, I heard an object striking the door. Then another. I opened the door and saw him scurry away from the bottom of the stairs. Riled up, I marched down to his room and demanded that he clean up the toys he had thrown.</p>
<p>“There will be no turn at all tomorrow for you if you don’t clean up those toys!”</p>
<p>“I don’t care! I will never clean them up. I never want another turn ever!”</p>
<p>Thankfully, at that point I closed his door and went upstairs. A few minutes later, I heard something on the stairs again. I moved to the door and found it locked. As I unlocked it and went back down to his room, I was ready to law down the law. I planned to speak harshly and let him know what he had done was wrong.</p>
<p>As I entered his room, and looked at him, a distinct thought came to my mind. I realized that the tone of voice I was about to use would strike him as clearly as if I had hit him. I saw, not a disobedient troublemaker, but a young boy angry and disappointed.</p>
<p>Luckily, I caught myself in time. I spoke calmly to him, and told him that going up and down the stairs would keep his baby brother awake and I needed him to not do that.</p>
<p>I felt a great sense of relief. Hopefully next time I can remember the first time to avoid verbal violence.</p>

			 <p>A huge part of seeing and treating others as people, as well as increasing efficiency and productivity, involves understanding when to communicate asynchronously, and when to be synchronous.</p>
<p>We often default to ways of communicating that reduce others to objects and decrease their and our ability to work well. We are inundated with information, and yet spend little time considering different modes of communication and deliberately deciding which to employ.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>
<p>Default to asynchronous communication to honor others as people, improve critical thinking, and increase productivity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asynchronous most of the time, synchronous when needed</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h2>
<p>Many different methods of communication exist, and we should be thoughtful about which one we choose to use for a given moment.</p>
<p>Synchronous, or real-time communication expects immediate responses. This includes forms such as meetings, drive-by interruptions, and chat pings. Benefits include speed, information density, and impacts on relationships. Costs include treating people as objects, less critical thinking, and productivity losses.</p>
<p>Asynchronous communication decouples the message and response. Forms include email, chat, and long-form writing. Costs include delays, possible misinterpretation, and additional required skills. Benefits include slowing down, respect, and productivity increases.</p>
<p>Organizations should find a balance in synchronicity. I recommend four concrete steps to improve communication. First, establish cultural norms explicitly. Second, hold fewer better meetings. Third, move more to asynchronous communication. And fourth, establish a single shared repository for information. As part of these recommendations, I strongly encourage that email is eliminated as an internal communication method.</p>

<p>I want to start with the distinction between synchronous and asynchronous communication. Here are my own definitions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Synchronous.</strong> Real-time communication where the delay between a message and response is expected to be next to nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Asynchronous.</strong> Communication where the message and response are decoupled. The sender has no expectation that the receive will reply immediately.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="communication-methods">Communication methods</h4>
<p>As part of defining synchronicity, I think it is useful to identify some of the methods we use to communicate with others. Here is a possible hierarchy, from the most synchronous to the most asynchronous.</p>
<ul>
<li>Planned in-person conversation</li>
<li>Shoulder-tapping</li>
<li>Planned video call</li>
<li>Planned audio call</li>
<li>Unplanned call</li>
<li><em>Personal text message</em></li>
<li><em>Direct chat message</em></li>
<li><em>Mention in group chat</em></li>
<li><em>Request through workflow process</em></li>
<li><em>Message in group chat</em></li>
<li><em>Personal email</em></li>
<li><em>Group email</em></li>
<li>Mention in wiki<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
<li>Wiki post in monitored space</li>
<li>Wiki post in unmonitored space</li>
</ul>
<p>Where I have seen the most problems is in the emphasized middle section. This is due to a mismatch in expectations. One person may expect an immediate response and become frustrated at any delay, where the other person thought that they could respond when convenient.</p>
<h3 id="synchronous-communication">Synchronous communication</h3>
<p>In many organizations, the default method of communicating has become synchronous. We often talk about the work instead of doing the work.</p>
<h4 id="meetings">Meetings</h4>
<p>Meetings appear to be the most efficient way to gather information, or align a group. Meetings are held to get status updates, or communicate direction and vision for a project. We come together to brainstorm or to make decisions. We call groups together so that no one is left out or lacking important details about something that might affect them. In a meeting-addicted culture, we default to “getting the right people together” in order to solve something. As I will discuss later, there are many hidden costs to meetings that we rarely consider when scheduling or hosting them.</p>
<h4 id="drive-by-interruptions">Drive-by interruptions</h4>
<p>When people are colocated, there can be a temptation to walk over to someone and ask them a question directly. We often preface this interruption with a platitude, “Sorry to interrupt, but…” or “Quick question for you…” or “Do you have a minute?” This kind of interaction is insidious, because it appears to be efficient. The needed information or decision is received quickly, and then both people can move on with their work without being blocked. I will address some of the true costs in a minute.</p>
<h4 id="chat-ping">Chat ping</h4>
<p>Whether we are colocated or remote, the chat ping is one of the most frequently used forms of hidden synchronous communication. One person reaches out to another using some electronic tool with a question or request for a decision, and has the expectation of an immediate response. The expectation is not always made explicit, but is often made clear through repeated or impatient follow-up messages. Again, this interaction has the appearance of efficiency, with the true costs being hidden beneath the surface.</p>
<h4 id="synchronous-benefits">Synchronous benefits</h4>
<p>Part of the reason that we engage in synchronous communication so often is that there are many benefits, both real and perceived. I want to explore three of those benefits.</p>
<h5 id="speed">Speed</h5>
<p>When we come together and work through an issue or discuss a problem or brainstorm a solution, we are able to accomplish more in a shorter period of time. For emergency situations, this is vital. We do not have time to go back and forth and get everyone’s opinion or thoughts—we need to act.</p>
<p>Some of the situations that most benefit from being able to move forward more quickly are brainstorming and decision-making. When we are in a divergent phase of ideas where we want to explore more, coming together can facilitate this. People are inspired by others, and have ideas sparked by those that they hear, and we are able to generate many more ideas. When a decision needs to be made, it is often most efficient to finalize the discussion together and then have the person responsible make the final call.</p>
<h5 id="information-density">Information density</h5>
<p>Another benefit of synchronous communication is that we are able to take in more information at the same time. As humans, we are wired to process non-verbal cues alongside any explicit information that is being transferred. Having the opportunity to see and hear others as ideas are discussed or opinions are shared provides the ability to take in more information than would otherwise be possible.</p>
<h5 id="impact-on-relationships">Impact on relationships</h5>
<p>We are social creatures. We connect to others through seeing and hearing each other, and even more so by being physically present. Whether we are on a phone call, a video call, or together in person, we have the chance to strengthen the bonds between us. Through active listening, we can demonstrate to the other person that they matter to us, and they can see in a literal sense that we care about them.</p>
<h4 id="synchronous-costs">Synchronous costs</h4>
<h5 id="people-as-objects">People as objects</h5>
<p>The first cost of defaulting to synchronous communication is that we view others as objects. Instead of respecting their needs and priorities, we impose our will on them. We value our time and our efficiency over theirs. We reduce others to repositories of information, or decision-making vending machines.</p>
<h5 id="less-critical-thinking">Less critical thinking</h5>
<p>Synchronous situations are more charged and potentially stressful. We require those present to think through the matter at hand immediately and be able to share their thoughts. Some people thrive in this environment. Many people do not. Nearly all of us benefit from having time to collect our thoughts and deeply review the information that is relevant to whatever we need to discuss.</p>
<h5 id="productivity-losses">Productivity losses</h5>
<p>I mentioned before that defaulting to synchronous communication has the appearance of efficiency and productivity. This is an illusion.</p>
<p>When we gather a group together for a meeting, it can seem as if the meeting was a simple one hour event. But in reality, if ten people attend, it was a ten hour meeting. We fail to consider the opportunity cost of having those people stop whatever they were doing in order to participate.</p>
<p>Another major problem with a meeting is the limiting effect it has. Meetings give privileged access to the attendees that is not afforded to current or future team members that may be in need of that access.</p>
<p>Part of the productivity hit that comes from an interruption is the recovery time. Every employee can benefit from uninterrupted focus time to consider their work and how they might approach it better. Having dedicated blocks of uninterrupted time is even more vital for knowledge workers. Many people in provide the most value through creative problem solving. Having meetings or other interruptions destroys a person’s ability to focus deeply.</p>
<h3 id="asynchronous-communication">Asynchronous communication</h3>
<h4 id="methods">Methods</h4>
<p>There are different forms of asynchronous communication available to most workers. There are three that I want to mention separately.</p>
<h5 id="email">Email</h5>
<p>The most common form is email. This is the tool that many people naturally employ in order to reach someone else, either to provide or to request information. It is a simple, ubiquitous way to communicate with others.</p>
<h5 id="chat">Chat</h5>
<p>Many organizations adopt some form of instant messaging software to allow employees to reach others more directly. This is a fantastic way to reach others when used properly and recognized as an asynchronous tool. It can also turn into an all-day meeting where attention and focus are constantly interrupted.</p>
<h5 id="long-form-writing">Long-form writing</h5>
<p>Many organizations also have some kind of wiki or shared repository of information. In the best environments, everyone can access all content, except sensitive information that needs to be protected.</p>
<p>As compared to the previous two of email and chat, long-form writing has the effect of helping the creator solidify their thoughts more fully. When this writing is in a shared space, it also leads to greater access and can empower people to accomplish more on their own.</p>
<h4 id="asynchronous-costs">Asynchronous costs</h4>
<h5 id="delays">Delays</h5>
<p>One of the first problems that most people see with asynchronous communication is an increase in overall time. Because answers are not immediately provided, people are waiting more often. This can lead to decisions being held up, or people wasting their time waiting on others. As I will explore later, this is not all bad, but it is a very real cost and needs to be considered.</p>
<h5 id="possible-misinterpretation">Possible misinterpretation</h5>
<p>Many of us have had the experience of sending someone an email or a text, and having our intent completely misunderstood. Written communication can lack some of the nuance that is conveyed in facial expressions, body language, or tone of voice. If we are not careful, moving more to asynchronous communication can result in colder relationships or conflicts, whether perceived or real.</p>
<h5 id="more-skill-required">More skill required</h5>
<p>Not everyone is a skilled writer. Many people struggle to be concise in writing, and are not practiced at sharing their thoughts in a coherent way. Taking the time to write out our thoughts can have the effect of crystallizing our thinking, which can help us deliver it more clearly, whether through writing or not. But a very real cost of moving to more asynchronous communication is that people will need to practice more and become more skilled at sharing their thoughts in written form. This can take time, and can be frustrating to some people.</p>
<h4 id="asynchronous-benefits">Asynchronous benefits</h4>
<p>Asynchronous communication is not always the best or the right fit, but it can have many advantages.</p>
<h5 id="slowing-down">Slowing down</h5>
<p>One of the first is that it is often slower. At first glance, this seems like more of a disadvantage, but in most cases, it leads to better outcomes. Take the example of an important decision. Our instinct may be to call a quick meeting of everyone involved or affected and come to a decision so that it can be implemented. In a true emergency situation, this is exactly what we should do. But most of the time, we benefit by slowing down the process and giving those involved time to consider the situation and the implications of different courses of action. This leads to a better decision in the end.</p>
<h5 id="respect">Respect</h5>
<p>Another major advantage of defaulting to asynchronous communication is the respect it demonstrates to other people. In this way, we truly see and value others as people, and do not reduce them to objects. We recognize that they will have their own needs and priorities that may or may not align with ours. When we communicate in a way that allows others to process and address our message at a time that works best for them, we honor them and improve our relationships.</p>
<h5 id="productivity-increase">Productivity increase</h5>
<p>A natural consequence of these first two advantages, and an advantage in its own right, is an overall increase in productivity. In the case of decision making, being able to make a better decision the first time means that there will be fewer negative consequences and time lost revisiting the issue down the road. In the case of information requests, an individual is able to find out information by themselves without having to ask anyone. This preserves the time and attention of the person who is the potential source of the information, as well as the person who needs the information. This empowers people to more easily solve problems by themselves.</p>
<h3 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h3>
<p>Overall, my strong recommendation is that organizations and individuals find a healthy balance between synchronous and asynchronous communication. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, or magic formula that will work for everyone. As with most things, the best results often come from a middle path where we avoid extremes in either direction.</p>
<p>That being said, I believe that this general rule is helpful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asynchronous most of the time, synchronous when needed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a few concrete recommendations that build on each other, starting with the simplest and most immediate and moving to the most involved and potentially challenging.</p>
<h4 id="establish-cultural-norms">Establish cultural norms</h4>
<p>My first recommendation is the easiest to implement. I shared earlier a list of different <a href="#communication-methods">communication methods</a>. Individuals, teams, departments, and even the organization as a whole can create a list of the communication methods they choose to follow in. Additionally, this list can establish expected response times.</p>
<p>An example is as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Method</th>
<th style="text-align:left">When appropriate</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Expected response time</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Repeated calls</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Emergency situation</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Immediate to a few minutes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Direct call</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Urgent situation</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Immediate to an hour</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Direct message/mention</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Timely response needed</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Within half a day</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Wiki comment</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Important decision</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Within one business day</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Wiki mention</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Information request worth saving</td>
<td style="text-align:left">One to three business days</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Group message</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Non-urgent one-off information request</td>
<td style="text-align:left">One to three business days</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Wiki post</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Information sharing</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Within one week if needed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">External email</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Communication outside organization</td>
<td style="text-align:left">One to three business days</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Internal email</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Not appropriate</td>
<td style="text-align:left">No response expected</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Establishing and publishing such a list can help build a culture that prioritizes meaningful work and creates space for people to do that work. This can also ensure that needed information flows throughout the organization and becomes increasingly available for everyone who might need it.</p>
<h4 id="fewer-better-meetings">Fewer better meetings</h4>
<p>My second recommendation is to improve the quality of our meetings. Too often, we get together just because of tradition, or because it seems to make sense that we should get a few people together. We lack purpose and clarity in why we are meeting, and we invite too many people.</p>
<p>We need to meet less often. And when we do meet, we need to have a clear purpose. One simple approach is to start the meeting with a question, and when that question is answered, stop the meeting.</p>
<p>We need to weigh the benefits and costs and consciously choose that a meeting is the best way to achieve our desired outcomes.</p>
<h4 id="move-more-to-asynchronous">Move more to asynchronous</h4>
<p>My third recommendation is that we start defaulting to asynchronous more of the time. A practical example of that would be to use chat tools more often, and to consider them as truly asynchronous tools. Instead of messaging people directly, ask your question in a space where multiple people could see it and answer, and then move on to other things that you need to do. Get in the habit of not expecting an immediate answer.</p>
<p>The necessary corollary to this is that we become more reliable at checking in on messages that we have received and responding in a timely manner. If we are in a role that needs to provide information to others to unblock them, we respect them by checking more regularly and responding more quickly. But we still honor ourselves and those we help by focusing on the deep, meaningful work we can do most of the time, and spend less of our time responding to interruptions.</p>
<h4 id="single-shared-repository">Single shared repository</h4>
<p>My next recommendation is to reduce the number of tools used for communication, and particularly the places where people need to look for information. The first and most pressing need is to eliminate email as a communication method as much as possible. Email is inherently limiting while also producing noise and distraction. When important information is communicated via email, it is available only to those who received the email. Because of this, often too many people are included in an email to mitigate the risk of excluding someone. This is a pernicious practice that perpetuates exclusion and pulls people away from their most important work.</p>
<p>In my previous recommendation, I stated that more communication should happen via chat. Here I want to go a step further and say that our most important communication should happen in a shared space such as a wiki. If we reach decisions in chat, they should be recorded in the wiki. Even better, longer discussions and decisions can be reached in the wiki itself. We can make use of commenting features to allow people to share their thoughts and ideas in the context of the necessary information. This encourages people to take the time to form their thoughts, and to share a complete thought rather than a line at a time.</p>
<p>One crucial aspect to this is standardizing on the repository for this important information. Too often, different departments each store their information in a way that is traditional for them, and so information is scattered across many different tools. An organization has to be willing to prioritize effective communication and invest the time and money in selecting, promoting, and using a shared tool.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Communication is central to all that we do as people, particularly in the workplace. The methods that we choose to employ, and the habits that we form will dictate the kind of work that we are able to perform. Synchronous communication has a valuable place, but when it is overused, drastic consequences can follow. Asynchronous communication as the default respects people as people, creates space for critical thinking, and increases productivity. Choose to value the people currently in your organization, and those that will join later by committing to communicating asynchronously more often.</p>

			 <p>My wife came down to grab her phone and called a greeting through my office door. I popped out to say hi, and we were embracing when our 8yo came down the stairs. I didn’t know who it was, but I could hear a child coming down, so I said, “Hold on! We’re having a moment.”</p>
<p>From the stairs, he said, “Nuts!”</p>
<p>Then he came around the corner and saw us kissing, he said, “Ew! Ok, I will wait.”</p>
<p>After maybe ten more seconds, he said, “You guys do that all the time. You’ve done it for like 50 days.”</p>
<p>Wife: “Oh, I wish!”</p>
<p>Me: “One day, maybe you will have a moment too, with your wife.”</p>
<p>8yo: “I don’t think I’ll want to do that.”</p>
<p>We couldn’t keep going for laughing, so we separated, and I started for him, and said, “Now it’s your turn!”</p>
<p>8yo: “Yikes! No, I don’t want that.”</p>
<p>After we talked for a little bit (about <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/08/27/thought-not.html">the coupons</a>), he went to leave, and I said, “Now I want to have to have a moment with you.”</p>

			 <p>One of the most common benefits that I have heard identified through the pandemic and quarantine was additional free time. Every time I heard that, my blood temperature went up a little bit more. My experience has been the complete opposite.</p>
<hr>
<p>We are coming up on three months since many of us have been forced to work from home. Throughout that time, I have heard often about the surfeit of discretionary time that we all theoretically have. This has been so far from my experience that I wanted to consider it a bit deeper.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the difference in my experience is that my wife and I have seven children, ages fifteen down to ten months. Before all of this began, I did have to commute for an hour and a half to two hours every day, and so I expected to have more time at my disposal. And in some ways, I did.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about time is that we never truly have more or less of it. The perceived differences from day to day, or year to year, are just that—perceived. Every one of us has exactly the same amount of time in every day. The issue is how we choose to spend it.</p>
<p>I have found that the feeling of having free time is largely a function of how much time appears to be in your control, with no pressing obligations. Once you feel a responsibility to do something with a block of time, it no longer feels like free time. This is the case even if the responsibility is completely self-imposed.</p>
<p>This is why spending hours consuming media is so seductive. When you choose to engage in a passive activity such as consumption, there is no feeling of responsibility. You allow yourself to cater to your whims, and in so doing, pursue an escape. The irony of this course of action is that you are usually just falling into the control of the algorithm, instead of being in control yourself. Big media companies know and understand how valuable your time and attention are, and have invested heavily in understanding how to co-opt that.</p>
<p>Because of my choices to have a large family, when I am faced with “extra” time during the day, by default, that time goes to my wife or children. I have to work to make a conscious decision to do something different. And since we are all together even more than before, my sense of time to myself in which I get to choose what I do is more diminished than ever.</p>
<p>The nice thing about writing about this is getting more clarity about my own situation. In the course of this article, I have gone from feeling frustrated at missing out on a shared experience that seems to be all around me, to reclaiming my sense of agency in knowing that I get to choose how to spend my time.</p>
<p>The minutes of our lives are a precious commodity that can easily be spent mindlessly. Those minutes turn into hours and days and months and years in which we can accomplish and grow and change, or stagnate and coast. I hope that I can remember the lesson of COVID-19 for me—there never is more or less free time in my life, just how I choose to use my twenty-four hours in the day.</p>

			 <p>We have to be so careful anytime that we view individuals primarily through the lens of a group to which they belong. This can creep in to our lives even through a positive guise, such as appreciating health care workers.</p>
<hr>
<p>One thought that I have been having through this global pandemic is that our group of societal heroes has expanded. Of course, not everyone feels this way, but the general view of society has evolved throughout my lifetime. I first saw that members of the military were seen as heroes. Following 9/11, first responders and firefighters joined in the hero category. And then with COVID-19, health care workers have become included as well.</p>
<p>In many ways, this is a wonderful thing. I am a huge fan of any increase in our care and compassion and tendency to view others positively. Many of us who view these groups in a favorable light do so because we consider that they are sacrificing some of their interests in the service of others, which is certainly laudable.</p>
<p>As I have thought more and more about this phenomenon, in addition to the gratitude and excitement that I have for an increase in positive sentiment, I have started to have grave concerns. One lesson I have learned through my experience with OCD and various forms of treatment is that our ways of thinking form patterns. The more we mentally traverse those patterns, the more instinctual they become. It is as if we are riding a bike on a dirt road through our mind, and as we ride the same path over and over, we form a rut which locks our tires into traveling the same exact line with little to no effort.</p>
<p>The implications of these two phenomena colliding are sobering and even damning. This is one way that we arrive in a situation of needing a movement like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter">Black Lives Matter</a>. I am not saying that everyone who celebrates those in the military, or first responders, or health care workers is doomed to become bigoted and racist. What I am saying is that if we are not aware and attentive, the same forces that pull on us to admire certain people solely because of their membership in a group we find admirable can also lead us to overlook others simply because they belong to certain groups.</p>
<p>At the heart of the issue, in my mind, is a lack of seeing people as people. No one deserves to be heroized for mere membership in a group, just as no one deserves to be vilified because of belonging to a group. Our individual identity is what distinguishes us as people, not the groups or groups to which we belong.</p>
<p>My sincere hope is not that we will celebrate people less, but rather that we will think more and learn to see people more. From first-hand experience, I know that not everyone who wears a uniform is actually a hero. People made poor choices even when they are ostensibly part of a noble profession. And heroic acts and people are to be found in all walks of life.</p>
<p>It is time for us all to sit up and think. We are flooded with information, but even more damaging, inundated with voices telling us what opinions we should have about that information. It is far too easy for us to surrender our wills and suspend our critical thinking skills until they atrophy to the point of impotence.</p>
<p>People are not a color. People are  not a religion. People are not a uniform. People are not a profession. People are people. And they deserve to be treated as such.</p>

			 <p>I loved this article studying how the voices of women can be better fostered and heard: <a href="https://magazine.byu.edu/article/when-women-dont-speak/">When Women Don&rsquo;t Speak</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bottom line, if you want to empower women, apply majority rule when women have the numbers and unanimous rule—or at the very least, an underlying principle of unanimous rule, hearing from everyone—when they don’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>As a father of four girls, I find myself thinking a lot about gender roles and how to teach them, and my three boys, how to confront bias, whether conscious or not. As a manager of a software team that is 77% male, I spend a lot of time considering this as work as well. I was thrilled last week when my wife found and shared this article with me because she knew how much I care about this.</p>
<p>The answer to improving the gender gap is not necessarily always in raw numbers. The solution for my team is not to fire three of the men and hire women to have equal representation. I can’t change every department or every team at my company, or anywhere else.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean I am powerless.</p>
<p>There are subtle, and overt things that I can do to make sure that the voices of the women around me are encouraged and heard. I loved finding out in this article that one simple change—working in a unanimous instead of majority-based approach can have the effect of empowering everyone on the team to be heard, regardless of personality or biases.</p>
<p>Whether it is to address gender bias, or just to treat everyone as people that truly matter, I love that the effect of working for unanimous consensus is fewer negative interruptions, and more opportunity for everyone’s opinions to be heard.</p>
<p>I hope this is something I can implement on my team, and that it will make a difference. And I hope it doesn’t stop there.</p>

			 <p>My manager asked us to write up our thoughts on remote work, as we have all experienced a form of it in this pandemic. I decided I wanted to share my thoughts more broadly. With some edits for a more general audience, the text below is what I sent out.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have worked remotely either full-time or part-time for the last eight years. Prior to <a href="https://www.octanner.com/">O.C. Tanner</a>, I worked for <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>, a software company based out of Italy, which was entirely remote. I have strong feelings about this topic and the implications it has.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>
<p>Supporting remote work well requires and demonstrates high trust and is one of the best ways to recognize and treat employees respectfully as people. We should allow it.</p>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h2>
<p>We need to take this moment to thoughtfully consider how we can work best. Remote work is not the only answer; it is a compelling option that fits large parts of our company well, both in terms of our people and the work they do.</p>
<p>Colocated work has many benefits, and also serious challenges. Those challenges include defaulting to synchronous communication, selfish demands of immediate answers, reducing people to objects, cheapening in-person interactions, and providing an illusion of control or involvement.</p>
<p>Remote work encourages and facilitates many of the most important aspects of successful work. Those include respecting people as people, valuing and protecting the time and attention of others, communicating asynchronously most of the time and moving to synchronous when needed, and making important information and knowledge easily accessible.</p>
<p>The daily emails coauthored by our C.E.O. and HR leader throughout the pandemic are a fantastic example of connecting people asynchronously. They could be even better if not locked in our emails, but published in a company-accessible space, such as <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a> or <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>.</p>
<p>My hope is that we would institute a company policy of allowed remote work for designated departments, and in I.T. at least two days a week where everyone who is able is encouraged to work from home.</p>
<h2 id="full-thoughts">Full thoughts</h2>
<h3 id="requirements-for-remote-work">Requirements for remote work</h3>
<p>Remote work is not a good solution for everyone. To be a good fit depends mostly on personality and slightly on style and type of work. In order for someone to be well-suited for remote work, it is often ideal for them to possess the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Honest and mature—able to work effectively without direct supervision</li>
<li>Intrinsically motivated</li>
<li>Capable of independent thought and work</li>
<li>Not completely dependent on work for social interaction</li>
<li>Disciplined and able to stop working when needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Often, people get concerned that employees who work from home will shirk work and spend more time watching TV or attending to personal matters or taking naps. In most cases, the real problem with employees' work/life balance is that work encroaches on all other areas of life which leads to burnout. Generally, if leaders cannot trust their people to work, it does not matter where they are doing that work. If that is a concern of ours, I think it is a much bigger issue.</p>
<p>Often the best fit for style and type of work include some or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creativity or problem solving</li>
<li>Deep thought and consideration</li>
<li>Individual contribution</li>
<li>Occasional collaboration</li>
<li>Information sharing or data transfer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problems-with-colocated-work">Problems with colocated work</h3>
<p>Not everything about colocated work is bad—there are many positives, and many benefits that come from this kind of work better than in any other way. As humans, we are designed to be social creatures, and processing the rich input stream of emotional and nonverbal communication that comes from being in person with someone is huge.</p>
<p>However, in a professional sense, there are many potential challenges. One of the first is that being physically close establishes a default of synchronous communication. This encourages shoulder-tapping, and fosters a culture of ASAP, where people become accustomed to getting answers immediately. At first glance, this may appear to be positive—we can seem to be more efficient, and in some cases, we truly are in the short-term. The insidious truth about this environment is that it is inherently selfish. Instead of seeing others as people, we see them as objects that exist to provide us with information or to get us unstuck when we feel the need. Instead of sitting in our own discomfort of not knowing something immediately, or searching it out ourselves, or just waiting until it is convenient and productive for the other person to respond, we place our own needs above theirs. This can lead to an almost unconscious perspective of viewing others as objects instead of people.</p>
<p>Another major problem with primarily colocated work is the cheapening of in-person interactions. I think many of us have noticed the inverse of this through our experience with the current pandemic. Because we have been isolated, those instances where we are able to be in person with someone are truly valued. Many people experience this as well when living away from family or friends—we often see loved ones less, but value the experience more. When I worked for a fully-remote company, we found this to be extremely true. We had an annual company retreat where we all gathered together for a week and a half, and would have mini retreats once or twice a years as smaller teams. Those times were special to build and strengthen relationships and create memories, and greatly enhanced our ability to work remote effectively.</p>
<p>The final problem with colocated work that I have seen is the illusion of control or involvement. For much of human history, there has been something seductive about being able to see people in order to know that they were behaving as we expected. In the workplace, we can, sometimes unconsciously, associate someone being at their desk as them working or being productive. This is a horrible measure of productivity. Again, it reduces people to objects, and tells them that their worth to the company is not the value they provide, but the hours they spend in a certain location. When this illusion is removed, it requires leaders to step up and discern how to measure the value that employees provide, both to track their productivity, and to help them grow as individuals.</p>
<h3 id="how-successful-remote-work-looks">How successful remote work looks</h3>
<p>In my experience, when everyone is colocated, we think less about how successful work looks, but when we consider remote work, it becomes top of mind. I think we should take advantage of the situation we are in to consider how we could be more successful in general. I want to share my opinions on how successful work looks. It so happens that working remotely encourages these behaviors and characteristics.</p>
<p>The first and most important point is that people are respected as people, and their time and attention is valued and carefully protected. We all recognize and appreciate the value that each person provides, and take the time to learn how others work, and how we can best interact with them to respect and empower them. In practice, this often looks like waiting more often. Instead of demanding that people stop what they are doing in order to deal with us and our needs, we carefully consider first whether we actually need to interrupt them. If we determine that it is necessary, we do so in a way that allows the person to continue what they are doing, and respond when it is convenient for them. Inversely, we respect the requests from other people, and respond as quickly as appropriate. If we are in a position or a role where we need to provide more time-sensitive information, we respect others by checking more regularly to see if there are requests to which we need to respond.</p>
<p>A related principle is that we communicate asynchronously most of the time, and move to synchronous when needed. There are situations, such as debates, or final decisions, that can be done more effectively and efficiently in a synchronous manner. Those are often best facilitated by prior asynchronous communication, where everyone involved was able to consume and process the relevant information on their own time, and were able to take the time to dive as deep as needed in order to understand it sufficiently to make a sound decision. In many cases, I have seen that the act of taking time to write out your thoughts on an issue helps to crystallize and distill those thoughts. All of this leads to better thought and better decisions.</p>
<p>That leads to my final point, which is that information needs to be recorded in a way that is easily findable. Often, this means in some kind of shared location that is organized well so that it is easily browsable and searchable. When conversations, or worse decisions, are scattered across many different mediums, or trapped in email or verbal conversations, we drastically reduce access to that information. This decision, whether made consciously or unconsciously, prevents transparency and excludes people. Those affected include current employees who are not involved, and especially all future employees. Making this wealth of knowledge and information available is another form of respect.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We will rarely have the opportunity that has been forced on us by this pandemic to re-evaluate the basic ways in which we operate and work together. It would be a tragedy if we did not leverage what we have seen and learned through this experience. One point that has been made repeatedly is that many parts of the company have actually become more productive during this time. I think it is easy for us to gloss over the significance of that fact. Our lives have been severely disrupted. The level of uncertainty we have all experienced is unprecedented in most of our lifetimes. We have not actually been working remotely—we have been surviving a crisis, and forced to cope in whatever way we can. For some people to have become more productive during this time speaks volumes to the potential of remote work, especially if it is approached thoughtfully and done deliberately. Not everyone will choose to work remotely, and I think it would be a mistake to force them to do so. It is not the best fit for everyone. But neither is colocated work. We should respect our people enough to be flexible and open to the way in which they can best work.</p>
<p>To succeed in working remotely, our leaders will have to step up. One of the most beautiful examples of that throughout this pandemic is the daily emails coauthored by our C.E.O. and HR leader. I have heard from so many people who have been encouraged and uplifted and have felt more connected to each other and to the company through those message. In some ways, it is sad that it took a crisis like this for us to start reaching out to the whole company in that way. It also seems unfair to me that one or two people seem to have carried so much of that burden. My one wish is that those touching messages were not trapped inside email. How helpful and inspiring it would be to have all of those messages preserved somewhere like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a> or <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> where everyone could still be notified of them, but have them archived and available for reference and future employees. (Note: I realized nothing was stopping me from doing exactly that, so I have copied and pasted the emails in a Confluence page).</p>
<p>I strongly hope that we will take this opportunity to consider how best to work. I would love to be involved in exploring what that could look like, and thrilled to share my experience working remotely.</p>
<h3 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h3>
<p>Based on all that we have seen, I suggest that we institute a policy of allowed work for designated departments. There are obviously some groups, such as Manufacturing, Security, Maintenance, and others who cannot work remotely. But for those groups who can, such as Client Success, Marketing, I.T., and others, I think we should just give everyone in those departments full permission to work remotely if they want. Individuals teams will naturally establish norms of communication and schedules of synchronous time, including in person if needed. We should demonstrate to those people, and to the company that we trust them. If there are problems, those should be dealt with individually, and others should not have their flexibility curtailed as punishment.</p>
<p>Further, in I.T. we have seen that synchronous communication when remote is most effective when most people are in the same situation. I think that we should encourage everyone who can in I.T. to work remotely on designated days, such as Tuesday and Thursday. It would be even better to designate one of those days as a no-meeting day and work to truly protect the quiet work time that is needed for I.T. success.</p>

<p>Leadership permeates our lives. Good leadership has the ability to uplift, just as poor leadership corrodes. We will consider the effects in terms of <strong>team makeup</strong>, <strong>team perspective</strong>, and <strong>team health</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Note: This is part of a series sharing my thoughts on leadership. Read the introduction <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/13/thoughts-on-leadership.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In this final article of my series on leadership, I want to tie everything together. So far, I have written about the <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/14/leading-through-trust.html">importance of trust</a>, a leader’s role to <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/15/a-leaders-role.html">protect</a> and <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/17/a-leaders-role.html">provide</a> which both require high trust, and the <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/21/stages-of-leadership.html">three stages of leadership</a>, the highest of which, servant leader, is the only that actually fulfills the roles completely. I want to conclude with the consequences of all of this.</p>
<p>As I constantly try and help my seven young children understand, we are free to make our own choices, but we do not get to choose the consequences of those choices. Therefore, it is vitally important that we understand the natural results of different courses of action so that we have the ability to influence them.</p>
<p>There are a number of different effects of leadership that we could consider in evaluating the impacts of the stages of leadership. As a quick review of <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/21/stages-of-leadership.html">my last article</a>, those stages are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cruel tyrant</strong>. Punishes bad behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Benevolent dictator</strong>. Rewards good behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Servant leader</strong>. Unblocks and trusts.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will explore just a few of the possible effects: <strong>team makeup</strong>, <strong>team perspective</strong>, and <strong>team health</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="team-makeup">Team makeup</h2>
<p>On a team that is led by a cruel tyrant, people are not focused on achieving together. They are just worried about their own necks. This type of leader creates a team comprised of <strong>scared, resentful individuals</strong>. The potential output of this team vastly exceeds their reality because most of their time and energy is being spent trying to ensure survival.</p>
<p>With a benevolent dictator, the overall tenor improves. People on the team are not operating as much out of fear. This leader creates a team of <strong>happy, complacent individuals</strong>. They have been robbed of their intrinsic motivation for their work, and now respond mainly to external motivators—rewards. The quality of their work usually falls to whatever level is required in order to be recognized, or to stand above their peers. Much of their time and energy is spent seeking advantage over others.</p>
<p>A servant leader creates a completely different kind of team. Instead of disparate individuals, a sense of <em>esprit de corps</em> prevails. This leader fosters a <strong>united, driven team</strong>. Because the efforts and energy of these people are dedicated to their common objective, much more is typically accomplished. Members of the team feel a sense of belonging to something bigger than themselves, and they are willing to make personal sacrifices to ensure the success of the group.</p>
<h2 id="team-perspective">Team perspective</h2>
<h3 id="cruel-tyrant">Cruel tyrant</h3>
<p>A cruel tyrant views other people, especially those on their team, as <strong>disposable</strong>. The people themselves don’t matter—as long as they don’t create problems, they are largely ignored. In the parlance of <a href="https://arbinger.com/home.html">Arbinger Institute</a>, these leaders see others as objects, and more specifically, as <strong>irrelevancies</strong>.</p>
<p>This has a dramatic effect on the members of the teams led by cruel tyrant. Because they are living and working in fear, other people on the team or in the organization are <strong>enemies</strong>. Each one is a possible informant; someone watching for the slightest mistake in order to report and thus avoid personal punishment.</p>
<h3 id="benevolent-dictator">Benevolent dictator</h3>
<p>Benevolent dictators have a similar, but slightly different view of others. The people still don’t matter, but the results do. Others are viewed as <strong>potential output</strong>. Again, in the <a href="https://arbinger.com/home.html">Arbinger Institute</a> language, other people are objects, specifically <strong>vehicles</strong>. The leader may be nice, and even act caring, but all in the service of achieving the desired results.</p>
<p>On teams with a benevolent dictator as the leader, people see each other as <strong>competitors</strong>. One person’s success means another person’s lost opportunity, so team members are constantly looking to one-up each other. They similarly see others as objects, in the <a href="https://arbinger.com/home.html">Arbinger Institute</a> sense, but now as <strong>blockers</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="servant-leader">Servant leader</h3>
<p>With a servant leader, all of the insecurities are removed. This doesn’t mean those leaders and those teams are perfect. But they all see each other as <strong>people</strong>. No one matters more, or less, than anyone else. This allows them to work together in a united way to accomplish whatever outcomes they have prioritized. As mistakes arise, people are understanding and forgiving of others, even when those mistakes are a failure to be understanding and forgiving. This is not only a nicer environment in which to work, but also the most logical and rational approach to business, and to life.</p>
<h2 id="team-health">Team health</h2>
<p>There are three areas in which the health of a team is affected by the leadership stage at work. If you think of the stages as a progression, these areas are all positively correlated, meaning that each increases with the stages. These are: <strong>psychological safety</strong>, <strong>conflict</strong>, and <strong>sustainability</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="psychological-safety">Psychological safety</h3>
<p>As the leader moves from the cruel tyrant to the benevolent dictator to the servant leader, the prevailing emotions change on a team. They go from <strong>fear and distrust</strong> to <strong>hope and greed</strong> to <strong>love and trust</strong>. As these emotions become more positive, the environment in which people live and work becomes safer. With that increase in safety, the emotional temperature changes. People are more free to speak their mind. Their thoughts are seen as valuable, and considered without prejudice. Creativity flows more naturally because the mental energy the team is expending focuses on the work instead of personal protection.</p>
<p>All of us face challenges and stresses to our mental health. When work is a place of high stress, we become less able to cope with the normal ups and downs of life. But when our professional life is rewarding as well as safe, we can develop greater reserves with which to meet the challenges that we will inevitably face.</p>
<h3 id="conflict">Conflict</h3>
<p>Some people are surprised to learn that healthier teams often fight more. Now, the word “fight” may not be the perfect term to capture exactly what is happening, but it is often how the situation looks to anyone on the outside. Having a healthier environment means that there is more opportunity for differing opinions to be shared and discussed productively. In my experience, people often get extremely passionate about the projects they are building, and the way in which they are built. Some of the best, and most productive conversations I have been part of were scarcely indistinguishable from heated arguments. The key is that the passion and emotion is directed at solving problems together, and not directed in animosity at other people.</p>
<p>This kind of conflict that exists on healthy team is sometimes hard to distinguish from a toxic environment. But there is a huge difference. It does not necessarily mean that members of the team want to hang out together outside of work hours. One of the key indicators is the level of respect that people have for each other. When respect is high, people are more able to bring all of themselves to a situation or a problem, and feel free to point out shortcomings that they see in the solutions being discussed.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that I bring this up and feel so strongly about it is that I have seen many leaders become so conflict-averse that they quell any disagreement out of fear that it could lead to an argument. Whether these leaders realize it or not, they are acting as dictators or even tyrants. They need to be more comfortable themselves with the knowledge that they will not always have the best ideas or solutions, and that the only way to maximize the ability of their team is to foster everyone contributing as much as they are able.</p>
<h3 id="sustainability">Sustainability</h3>
<p>I want to make one final point that feels intuitive to many of us, but also has a strong business or financial component. When people feel comfortable and respected, they are likely to do more and to do it better. They are also likely to want to keep doing it. These are the teams that are the longest lasting, as well as being the most productive.</p>
<p>As leaders, we are often seeking ways to unblock our teams, or to enable greater efficiency and greater productivity. The simplest answer is sometimes the easiest to overlook. The best thing we can do is not to set up extra programs or incentives or gamify work. Instead it is to become genuinely interested in the people that we lead and find ways to help them flourish and grow. Our job is to create an environment in which people can truly thrive, and then work carefully to maintain and enhance that.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>When I wrote my series on <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/18/what-mental-illness.html">what mental illness feels like</a> last year, I <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/27/i-finished-my.html">commented</a> that it was my best writing so far. I meant that in the context that it was the most impactful and meaningful writing I had done, not necessarily that it exhibited any special skill of mine as a writer.</p>
<p>I feel similarly about this <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/13/thoughts-on-leadership.html">series on leadership</a>. These concepts are some of the most important to me. They have been floating around in my mind for a long time, and it was extremely helpful to be asked to present on them and to be forced to take some time to crystallize them. I feel so strongly about the importance of good leadership, and I have ideas and thoughts about what that means that are ultra-specific to a degree not surprising to anyone who knows me.</p>
<p>My sincere hope is that something in this series has been helpful for you. But my primary audience for this is future me. I know that I will need a reminder of these principles that burn so brightly in me right now. Time and life have a way of dulling us, and if we are not intentional, we can lose some of the things that matter most to us now through neglect. Here’s to better leaders everywhere!</p>

			 <p>My friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joschaeffercrabb/">Jo Schaeffer</a> is participating in a podcast interview on creativity and posted the question, “What challenges do you have unleashing your inner creative?” I thought about this quite a bit, and decided I wanted to share my response.</p>
<hr>
<p>The biggest thing that helps me unlock my creativity is similar to what helps me have compassion for myself—just think of how I would treat others. My favorite thing to see from an artist is not the polished final product. Much more interesting is the rough work in progress. So even when I feel like my final product looks like a work in progress, and especially when it really is, I try to remind myself this is what I love to see from others.</p>
<p>My favorite book from my favorite artist is the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24820.Calvin_and_Hobbes">Calvin and Hobbes: Sunday Pages 1985-1995</a>. Each page shows his original drawings, complete with pencil lines and white out. It’s a treasure.</p>
<p>So often, the final product is distant and unreachable. We see what someone else has done, and think, “I could never do that.” But to see someone’s unfinished work is to be beckoned into the inner sanctum—to be trusted with raw vulnerability. That invitation is irresistible and inspiring.</p>

</p>
<p>Most people transition through three stages of leadership, whether consciously or not. These stages are the <strong>cruel tyrant</strong>, the <strong>benevolent dictator</strong>, and the <strong>servant leader</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Note: This is part of a series sharing my thoughts on leadership. Read the introduction <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/13/thoughts-on-leadership.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>As I start this article, I want to begin with a disclaimer. While the concepts here are similar to many leadership theories that exist, the stages that I have identified are completely of my own making. I say this not to claim originality, but rather as an advisory to the reader to not consider these stages to be official or based on extensive research. Any shared terminology with other leadership theories is coincidental. These ideas have been useful for me as I consider how to grow as a leader, and I hope they can be helpful to others as well.</em></p>
<p>The stages of leadership that I have identified can also be thought of as leadership styles. I like using the word “stage” to describe them, because I think there is a natural progression through these stages. Ideally, we can skip the early stages, or pass through them as quickly as possible. At times, however, we may backslide into those early stages, and need to be aware of them and recognize when we have fallen into that mindset and intentionally move forward.</p>
<p>The three stages of leadership that I have come up with exist on a spectrum, from worst to best. In this article, I will explore each one in detail. The stages are the <strong>cruel tyrant</strong>, the <strong>benevolent dictator</strong>, and the <strong>servant leader</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="cruel-tyrant">Cruel tyrant</h2>
<p><a href="https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2020/2b1deaf64a.jpg" 
   class="glightbox"

       style="border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%"
       alt="Cruel tyrant" 
        
  />
</a>

</p>
<p>A defining characteristic of a leader who is a cruel tyrant is that they seek to influence others by <strong>punishing bad behavior</strong>. They resort to threats or wield positional authority to ensure that all of their demands are met. They focus not on people, but on the behavior of those people, and try to shape it into what they want to happen.</p>
<p>This first stage that many leaders go through is almost all based on fear. The leader both feels and inspires fear. They may be afraid of the responsibility and feel inadequate. That fear can manifest through an attempt to control the output of the team and even the individuals themselves.</p>
<p>In many ways, this fear is understandable. Often, a new leader is promoted because of excellence as an individual contributor. But now they are no longer responsible for performing great work, they are responsible for ensuring that others perform great work. They may see that what they are measured on is results, and so they focus completely on results. They might not know how to motivate or inspire others to achieve those results, and so they fall back on the only thing they know.</p>
<p>This leader often insists on people working in a certain way, at a certain location, during certain hours because without this certainty, they feel helpless and out of control. They create a culture of mistrust and breed resentment among individuals. They rule with an iron fist and demand compliance. They may feel that people respect them, but in reality they are merely feared.</p>
<p>Most of us know what it is like to work with a leader in this stage, and find the experience demoralizing, demotivating, and dehumanizing.</p>
<h2 id="benevolent-dictator">Benevolent dictator</h2>
<p><a href="https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2020/cd63b96ebe.jpg" 
   class="glightbox"
   data-gallery="c34e41706cc86110e6aa9de1f197acbf"

  <img src ="https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2020/cd63b96ebe.jpg" 
       style="border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%"
       alt="Benevolent dictator" 
        
  />
</a>

</p>
<p>The mark of a benevolent dictator is that they try to influence others by <strong>rewarding good behavior</strong>. Again, they focus not on people, but rather their actions and try to shape them into something more desirable. They seem to be offering a lollipop, but in fact hide the sword that is implied in failing to measure up.</p>
<p>This next stage that most leaders go through is really just a more positive twist on the same theme as the cruel tyrant. In this stage, the leader is still focused on behavior and results, but seeks to influence others through reward instead of punishment. Because this leader is using rewards, they often think that they are a more positive leader and having a better impact on others. This is probably true—behavior is modified better through positive rather than negative consequences.</p>
<p>But there are still many problems with this approach to leadership. Treating people as if they are only as important as the results they provide is demeaning and leads to objectification. Those who are led in this way begin to spend their time and energy finding ways to get ahead or to get credit for positive results. Whereas with a cruel tyrant, people tend to just look out for themselves and try to not stick out or be noticed, a benevolent dictator encourages people to put others down in an effort to raise themselves up.</p>
<p>Motivation plummets when people are led in this way. Instead of allowing intrinsic desire and satisfaction to drive someone to excel, work is turned into a transaction. The only effort that will be expended is that required to qualify for the reward.</p>
<p>Again, most of us know what it feels like to work with a leader in this stage. We become more concerned with credit than results and our soul seeps away in the race to be seen.</p>
<h2 id="servant-leader">Servant leader</h2>
<p><a href="https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2020/6d97c02170.jpg" 
   class="glightbox"
   data-gallery="c34e41706cc86110e6aa9de1f197acbf"

       alt="Servant leader" 
        
  />
</a>

</p>
<p>The quality that distinguishes a servant leader is that they <strong>unblock and trust</strong> people. They see others as people, and take the time to get to know them and understand their strengths and limitations, and work to shape the environment to foster success. Only when operating this way can a leader truly perform their role to <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/15/a-leaders-role.html">protect</a> and <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/17/a-leaders-role.html">provide</a>.</p>
<p>This final stage is one of the most elusive. Unfortunately, it is not a destination. By its very nature, it is constantly changing and requires continuous work and investment to maintain. It is so easy to slip back into one of the previous stages, and so we must be vigilant and learn what our own warning signs of regression look like.</p>
<p>To be a true servant leader requires someone to be comfortable with themselves enough to know how they can help and lift others, and also comfortable enough with others to get out of their way and let them work. This leader is focused on empowering people, and <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/14/leading-through-trust.html">leads through trust</a>.</p>
<p>When problems arise, such as performance issues, the servant leader first looks at themselves to question whether they have provided sufficient clarity and training. Often, the first step to resolving issues like this is to better understand the perspective of the person who appears to be struggling. If the leader has done everything necessary, often they will probe into the life of the individual and see if there are challenges or circumstances affecting the person’s ability to perform.</p>
<p>This does not mean that a leader ignores all problems or difficult conversations, or that they never have to work through formal discipline. This leader recognizes that they must protect the team as well as individuals, and sometimes protecting the team means ending a formal work relationship with an individual, and ideally assisting them to find a path that could be a better fit.</p>
<p>As a servant leader, we recognize that we do not matter any more, or any less, than anyone else on the team. We have a different role to perform, and we can best serve the team by fulfilling that role in the best way we know how. We don’t have to possess all the answers—usually the best solutions come from the team. We need to work to recognize and elevate the humanity and vulnerability of each member on the team so that together success can be achieved.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As leaders, we need to become acutely aware of the style of leadership that we exhibit. Almost all leaders move through the three stages of <strong>cruel tyrant</strong>, <strong>benevolent dictator</strong>, and <strong>servant leader</strong>. Sometimes the transition between stages is unconscious, but we can work to be more intentional about the kind of leader that we want to be.</p>
<p><em>In the final article in my <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/13/thoughts-on-leadership.html">series on leadership</a>, I will be exploring the effects of the stages of leadership.</em></p>

<p>I believe that the most important roles a leader must serve are to <strong>protect</strong> and <strong>provide</strong>. I want to explore this further by considering how a leader can provide <strong>support</strong>, <strong>clarity</strong>, and <strong>results</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Note: This is part of a series sharing my thoughts on leadership. Read the introduction <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/13/thoughts-on-leadership.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In my last installment of my series on leadership, I explored the <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/15/a-leaders-role.html">role of a leader to <strong>protect</strong></a>. In my opinion, this comprises half of what a leader must do in order to be successful, with the other half being to <strong>provide</strong>. This may be an oversimplification, but it has been helpful for me to think about leadership in simpler terms so that I can better understand how to work to improve.</p>
<p>Again, these thoughts are set to the backdrop of my favorite definition of leadership by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nielnickolaisen">Niel Nickolaisen</a>, our CIO at O.C. Tanner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A leader is someone others choose to follow</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="provide">Provide</h2>
<p>Another archetypal leader that comes to mind for me is a kind of trail guide. I picture someone who has experience with the terrain, knows how to prepare for success, and is out in front of a group, showing them the way. The guide leads the group through crowded forests, up mountain passes, past precarious cliffs to an end destination that is fulfilling and rewarding for all. Along the way, the guide gives encouragement, performs first aid, assists in gathering nourishment, and ultimately is responsible for the group arriving safely.</p>
<p>In business, and in life, the role of a leader is similar, although perhaps less rugged at times. There are many ways that a leader can provide, and I will focus on these three:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support</li>
<li>Clarity</li>
<li>Results</li>
</ul>
<p>When I originally thought of these principles, I paired them together with those from the <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/15/a-leaders-role.html">role to <strong>protect</strong></a>. So, a leader will protect individuals and provide them support. A leader will protect the team and provide them clarity. And a leader will protect the company and provide it results. After thinking about these more, I have realized that all of the concepts are more intertwined.</p>
<h3 id="support">Support</h3>
<p>One of the first things that a leader must provide is support. Thinking first of providing support to individuals, a leader can do that through <strong>scheduled time</strong>. If the leader is also the reporting manager for an individual, that scheduled time should take the form of a regular one-to-one meeting. It is the leader’s responsibility to carve out that time, but the time belongs to the individual. This should be a time where the leader can learn how more about the individual and how to better support them. These meetings work best when regularly scheduled in advance, and when both participants can contribute to the agenda beforehand.</p>
<p>For those situations when the leader is not the direct manager of an individual, having scheduled time might look a little different. It could still take the form of one-to-one meetings, but it could also look like regular time to review work or to ask questions. The key is that the individual knows that they have your attention for a certain time, preferably undivided.</p>
<p>This can feel both overwhelming and comforting at the same time. It can be overwhelming if you are a leader responsible for many people. You may be wondering how you will ever find the time to devote to each person individually. As a father of seven children, I am familiar with this particular form of overwhelm.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is comfort in the fact that scheduling time for your people doesn’t require any special skills. You don’t actually have to be the best listener, or the most personable, or any superlative at all. You just have to be willing to put in the effort to show that you care. Just by scheduling the time, and muddling through as best as you can, you are clearly communicating to your people that they are valuable to you—valuable enough to displace other things that you could be doing.</p>
<h3 id="clarity">Clarity</h3>
<p>Clarity strikes me as a concept for which we all naturally yearn. As the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/29.18?lang=eng&amp;clang=eng#p17">book of Proverbs says</a>, “Where there is no vision, the people perish.” I have learned, through my experiences with mental illness, that uncertainty is a major trigger for many people. It gets exaggerated in those who struggle with some form of mental illness, but it affects all of us. A leader can do a great deal to instill calm and assurance that we can deal with the uncertainty that must exist, while simultaneously removing whatever is unnecessary.</p>
<p>For a team in particular, one of the greatest ways that a leader can provide clarity is through <strong>defined work</strong>. When a team can come together around a shared mission that they all understand and can see a path to accomplish, or at least to begin, something magical seems to happen. No longer are people spending mental energy grappling with the unknown—instead they are able to apply themselves completely to implementing the vision. People are more engaged and excited to come to work. As a software engineer, the lack of defined work is perhaps one of the largest factors I have seen in people leaving an organization.</p>
<p>This clarity can come to individuals in ways that unlock their potential as well. When someone knows exactly what is expected of them, and is empowered to take steps to fulfill those expectations, they often thrive and excel. When we don’t really know what success looks like, the situation can become demoralizing because we never know if we are making progress, treading water, or backsliding.</p>
<p>Companies also benefit from a leader who is able to provide clarity. Sometimes, the greatest service one can do is to say no to the right things at the right time. If a leader can be clear on what is included in a particular endeavor, and what needs to wait for the future, a company can relax and trust that things are going to work out. Of course, this requires the leader to provide the final piece as well.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>A leader is most often judged on what the people they lead can deliver. As an individual contributor, you are evaluated based on your personal results, but as a leader, you are responsible for the results of others. This can be disorientating and intimidating to new leaders. Earlier in my career, I found the lack of personal delivery a challenge in my creative fulfillment. Over time, I found greater joy and satisfaction in seeking to unlock others in their potential, and to see what we can accomplish as a group.</p>
<p>One of the best tools that a leader has to influence the results that are delivered is <strong>process</strong>. This can be an unglamorous view, but it is the simple, almost unseen structures that a leader puts into place that can truly facilitate people’s achievement. As a leader becomes more comfortable with process, and understands better how to shape and mold it in such a way to empower and unblock others, that leader becomes capable of more influence than ever.</p>
<p>One of the ways in which process can influence the delivery of results is through the safety and stability that it can provide. As humans, we are not thrown by difficult circumstances nearly as much as we by unanticipated circumstances. If we have a plan to attack an obstacle, then it becomes an opportunity rather than a hinderance.</p>
<p>As we as leaders come to embrace our role in honing and tweaking the process, we become invaluable to our organizations for our ability to influence and drive results. Our team and others can look to us for guidance on how to approach a given situation, and we can find the small points of friction that slow a team down and adjust to make improvements.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>Protecting</strong> and <strong>providing</strong> work seamlessly together to enable us as leaders to perform all of our necessary functions better. As we provide results, we are better able to protect our team, our people, and our company. We can serve as a beacon to follow as well as a shield to defend our people from distraction or outside pressure. Leadership is more important than ever, and I hope that it is helpful for you as it has been for me to distill the role of a leader down to simple terms.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the most important functions a leader fulfills is to <strong>protect</strong> and <strong>provide</strong>. There are many ways in which a leader can do those, and I will first explore how a leader can protect <strong>people</strong>, the <strong>team</strong>, and the <strong>company</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Note: This is part of a series sharing my thoughts on leadership. Read the introduction <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/13/thoughts-on-leadership.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>As I mentioned in my article on <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/14/leading-through-trust.html">trust</a>, I enjoy attempting to distill a complicated topic to the simplest terms I feel still capture its essence. In considering all of the many important functions a leader performs, I settled on categorizing them in just two groups: <strong>protect</strong> and <strong>provide</strong>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, when I speak of a leader, I do not refer just to those with positional authority. Anyone can be a leader, as illustrated by this definition from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nielnickolaisen">Niel Nickolaisen</a>, our CIO at O.C. Tanner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A leader is someone others choose to follow</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="protect">Protect</h2>
<p>When I think of an archetypal leader, an images that jumps to mind comes from warfare. I think of the leader as the person who is out in front, inspiring the troops to follow and rally to a cause. In that sense, the leader is literally protecting people, whether those that immediately follow, or those who live in increased safety because of the leader’s actions.</p>
<p>Of course, leadership does not necessarily require conflict, and certainly does not require bloodshed. Protecting can take many forms. There are three that I want to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>People</li>
<li>Team</li>
<li>Company</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="protecting-people">Protecting people</h3>
<p>As with almost everything that is work-related, leadership is primarily a personal matter. When we seek to protect others, we need to first see them as people, and focus on their individual needs. There is great opportunity for us to learn about the people who have already chosen, or who we hope will choose, to follow us.</p>
<p>One way in which we protect people is to ensure <strong>safety</strong> for them. This can take many forms, especially in the workplace, one of which is psychological. Anxiety is a natural response to a fear stimulus. If coming to work, or attending a meeting, or submitting code, or engaging with a certain person has the likelihood or potential to result in danger, our stress response will kick in. When we live in a constant, or even frequent, state of heightened tension like this, our health and productivity will sharply decline.</p>
<p>We need to create environments where people feel safe and secure. When they are able to let go of that fear response, their mental energies can be put to better and more productive use. When people feel free to speak up and share their thoughts, or to take risks and try new things, we unlock potential that is not accessible in any other way.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-a-team">Protecting a team</h3>
<p>While I have made a point of emphasizing that a leader can be anyone, my current role is a manager of a small team of software engineers. Because of that, much of my focus around leadership is from the perspective of a manager. When I think about what a leader of a team can do to protect them, the first thing that comes to my mind is shielding them to be able to focus. <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/"><strong>Deep work</strong></a> is a concept that I consider crucial, particularly for individual contributors, such as the programmers on my team.</p>
<p>So much of what we can do for our teams is to protect them from distraction or from undue outside influence. My experience is in the realm of software, and I have seen that people outside of the team often want to step in and push for certain features to be built. As a leader, we need to help our teams resist the urge to chase the new and the shiny. Much of that work comes in preventing direct access to our team members. Most people, especially developers, have an innate desire to please others and solve problems, and presented with the opportunity, will jump at the chance.</p>
<p>Another area in which teams often face pressure is in timelines or deadlines. Part of the challenge here is that the people who apply this pressure are typically in positions of authority. If the culture of an organization is unhealthy, a manager may not have the ability to protect the team. Hopefully, as leaders we can find ways to shape the environment so that our team can work without fear that they will be forced to release before they feel ready.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-the-company">Protecting the company</h3>
<p>Especially as a manager, but also as any kind of leader, we have the responsibility to protect the interests of the organization in addition to protecting the people and the team. One of the main ways in which we seek to strike this balance is through <strong>discipline</strong>. As with some of the other topics we have explored, there are multiple facets to consider.</p>
<p>Naturally, one aspect of this is the disciplinary action or conversations that a manager is required to handle. For those leaders who are not in positions of people management, disciplinary action may not be of the official variety, but they still can exert influence in ways to help others grow and improve. This kind of discipline can be challenging to administer, and requires a willingness to hold difficult conversations. In this way, we protect the company from possible negative consequences of poor performance or other issues.</p>
<p>Additionally, we protect the company by defining and executing a process with discipline. This requires personal discipline, as well as the ability to lead and inspire others to stay focused in their execution as well. As we work to instill professionalism in others, and help them stay connected to the objectives of the organization, we protect the company’s interests and ensure that, at least in our area of influence, things will continue to move forward.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are so many more things that could be said about the role of a leader to protect, but I am going to stop here. While this is not a comprehensive summary of everything that a leader needs to do, I feel that it is a helpful distillation of one half of the most important functions.</p>
<p><em>In my next article in my <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/13/thoughts-on-leadership.html">series on leadership</a>, I will explore the other half of a leader’s role: to provide.</em></p>

</p>
<p>As a leader, your most important commodity is <strong>trust</strong>. Every action you take, every word you say, every success you notice or ignore affects the trust others have in you.</p>
<p><em>Note: This is part of a series sharing my thoughts on leadership. Read the introduction <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/13/thoughts-on-leadership.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>One thing that I like to try and do is distill a complex topic down to a single salient point. As I thought and thought about leadership, I decided that the most important aspect is <strong>trust</strong>. I want to explore how I landed on that, and what the implications are.</p>
<h2 id="leadership-and-following">Leadership and following</h2>
<p>In order to simplify leadership down to a single idea, we must first describe what we mean by leadership. My favorite definition comes from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nielnickolaisen">Niel Nickolaisen</a>, our CIO at O.C. Tanner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A leader is someone others choose to follow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we consider whom to follow, there are logical and also emotional reasons at play. Logically, we seek assurance that choosing to follow someone will lead to positive outcomes. Emotionally, if we fear that our choice might cause us harm or bring great uncertainty, we are unlikely to pursue that option.</p>
<p>As we seek to become a leader, we have to realize that every action we take either increases trust in us or erodes it. When we cause uncertainty, those who might follow us will lose trust and will choose someone else. As trust wanes in us as a leader, we can only lead through positional authority. The only people following us then are those forced.</p>
<h2 id="trusting-others">Trusting others</h2>
<p>One of the simplest ways to earn trust is by demonstrating it in others. Too often, when we are placed in leadership roles in the workplace, we become insecure in ourselves and our ability to lead and influence others. We recognize that a result of good leadership is good output from those who report to us, and we narrowly focus on the end while ignoring the means. Ironically, this often drives us to micromanage or even redo work done by others in our quest for perfect results. This kind of behavior on our part may deliver short-term improvements, but as we overly control our people, we undermine our future success.</p>
<p>It is worth considering the different ways we can show trust or a lack of it to those we seek to lead. We may think that we trust our people, and not even realize that our actions communicate the opposite.</p>
<p>In a professional setting, one of the most common ways that leaders demonstrate a lack of trust is by requiring that work is done in a certain way. This may look like excessive check-ins, or stringent guidelines that spell out exactly how something must be accomplished. Naturally, there are times when exactitude is required, but most of the time, we can provide clear guidance of the outcomes that are desired, and leave up to those who will implement to determine the outputs necessary to achieve those outcomes.</p>
<p>Another common form of communicating a lack of trust is requiring that work happen in a specific location at specific hours. It is true that some activities are best performed in a face-to-face synchronous form. However, many professional activities, particularly those performed by an individual contributor, can be accomplished anywhere and at anytime. When we require that all work happen in the office during designated work hours, we effective communicate to our people that the time they are at their desk matters more than the work they do. We don’t trust them to get done what is needed in the right way, and so we have to monitor them constantly.</p>
<p>Trusting others is the right thing to do. In this way we honor the humanity of others and their right to learn and grow. They matter like we matter. Trusting them, and communicating that trust, is crucial to our development as leaders. This is also one of the best ways to develop the trust of others.</p>
<h2 id="building-trust">Building trust</h2>
<p>In addition to trusting others, there are a couple other key things we can do to help foster others’ trust in us: <strong>competence</strong> and <strong>care</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="competence">Competence</h3>
<p>Most people yearn to follow someone who actually knows what they are doing and is good at it. As we develop competence as a leader, we become that person others choose to follow. In future articles, I will explore in more detail what competence as a leader looks like. For now, it is enough to say that focusing on improving in our job is a great way to help instill confidence in others that we are likely to succeed as a leader and help them succeed as they follow us.</p>
<h3 id="care">Care</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there are many brilliant jerks in the world, and especially in the workplace. These are people who may be extremely hard-working and competent, but have a negative influence on people around them. They care much more about results than they do about people, and this ironically often leads to poorer results in the end.</p>
<p>A good leader builds trust by genuinely caring about other people. When we encounter someone who is skilled and competent, and also who clearly sees us as a person who matters like they do, we are much more likely to have confidence in what they might tell us. Our fears of ulterior motives dissipate, and we can trust that they are not putting their own interests above ours. This frees us up to follow without reserve and to accept direct, even harsh feedback at times, which can help us improve at an exponential rate.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Trust is the most precious coin a leader possesses. It must be careful cultivated and consciously spent. Almost every action contributes to an increase or a decrease in the trust others have in us. This makes the biggest difference in whether people will choose to follow us, or will reluctantly do what we ask out of obligation.</p>

</p>
<p>In my job as a software engineering manager, I was recently asked to speak about leadership. As I prepared the presentation, I realized that this topic is a passion of mine, even rivaling my passion for mental health awareness. I will share my thoughts over a series of articles.</p>
<hr>
<p>Leadership is a complex idea that means different things to different people. Often, we are thrust into roles in which we are expected or required to lead others. Many of us find these situations uncomfortable and find ourselves unprepared to take up the mantle laid upon us.</p>
<p>At the same work event where I presented, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nielnickolaisen">Niel Nickolaisen</a>, our CIO at O.C. Tanner, gave the most concise definition of a leader I’ve ever heard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A leader is someone others choose to follow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing that I love about this definition is how it highlights that anyone can be a leader regardless of role. We often think that leadership equates to having a position of authority, but this is a limited view. All of us can be the type of person whom others want to and actually decide to follow. Because of this universal applicability, I feel that the idea of good leadership is important and worth exploring further.</p>
<p>As I worked on my presentation, I was helped immensely by my good friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/duhadway">Jessica DuHadway</a>. She asked many clarifying questions and even agreed to rework some of the content and co-present with me. In this writing, I went back to the topics as I had developed them to make sure I wasn’t stealing her words or ideas.</p>

<p>As a leader, your most important commodity is <strong>trust</strong>. Every action you take, every word you say, every success you notice or ignore affects the trust others have in you.</p>

</p>
<p>In my opinion, the most important functions a leader fulfills is to <strong>protect</strong> and <strong>provide</strong>. There are many ways in which a leader can do those, and I will first explore how a leader can protect <strong>people</strong>, the <strong>team</strong>, and the <strong>company</strong>.</p>

<p>I believe that the most important roles a leader must serve are to <strong>protect</strong> and <strong>provide</strong>. I want to explore this further by considering how a leader can provide <strong>support</strong>, <strong>clarity</strong>, and <strong>results</strong>.</p>

</p>
<p>Most people transition through three stages of leadership, whether consciously or not. These stages are the <strong>cruel tyrant</strong>, the <strong>benevolent dictator</strong>, and the <strong>servant leader</strong>.</p>

<p>Leadership permeates our lives. Good leadership has the ability to uplift, just as poor leadership corrodes. We will consider the effects in terms of <strong>team makeup</strong>, <strong>team perspective</strong>, and <strong>team health</strong>.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.bennorris.com/2020/03/25/cursors-on-ipads.html">🔗 Cursors on iPads</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I loved this delightfully written article by Craig Mod: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ipad-trackpad-cursor/">Who Would Have Thought an iPad Cursor Could Be So Much Fun?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is where the iPad’s support for the trackpad comes in—a middle ground between laser and potato, and a reinvention of Engelbart&rsquo;s pointiness. Apple has taken the desktop cursor’s familiar thin arrow and replaced it with a translucent circle. This circle has the ability to change form not only with context but with the “physicality” of the object beneath it.</p>
<p>Move the pointer above a button and the circle morphs into the button itself, &ldquo;snapping&rdquo; into it, enveloping it like an amoeba, causing it to glow in a pleasing way. What this means is that the usual precision of a trackpad isn’t required to get exact hits on navigational elements. If you own an Apple TV, you’re already familiar with this vibe—it’s how the cursor on the TV “jumps” from icon to icon with a kind of sticky momentum. Similarly, on the iPad home screen, you can “lazily” slam the cursor around and have it lock onto applications with an eerie telepathy not experienced on a desktop OS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have used an iPad Pro as my primary machine for nearly a year now. I usually only go to my MacBook Pro when I need to work in Xcode, or do serious work in Jira. That’s the life of a software manager.</p>
<p>I actually have enjoyed using the Smart Keyboard Folio available with last year’s model of iPad Pro. But when I saw the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-keyboards/">Magic Keyboard</a> announced last week, I was ecstatic. Alas, like everyone else, I have to wait until May to really try it out.</p>
<p>But I installed iOS 13.4 yesterday and immediately connected a Bluetooth trackpad to try out the new support. I remember last summer when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647071/apple-ipad-os-mouse-support-wwdc-2019">mouse support was announced as an accessibility feature</a>. At the time, I dismissed it as something that I wouldn’t really need or use. When I saw the new demo video, my interest was piqued, and I gave it a try.</p>
<p>All of my doubt was swept away in an instant. In a way that I never expected, the cursor feels right at home. It appears when I touch the trackpad, and disappears when I type or touch the screen. Hovering over buttons or apps is intuitive and delightful. I never wonder where the cursor went or what is happening. As Craig Mod said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And yet somehow, the overall effect of using a trackpad with an iPad is more convincing than direct manipulation, less exhausting, and simply more <em>fun</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I look forward to using the newest Magic Keyboard in a few months. Until then, I will happily use my iPad with a trackpad sitting next to it.</p>

			 <p>One of the ways I was profoundly affected by my recent trip to our India office was in observing the manner in which the people worked. I am still considering how to apply what I saw and learned.</p>
<hr>
<p>As I <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2020/03/06/driving-without-lights.html">wrote about recently</a>, I had the opportunity to travel to India last week. We were able to visit some amazing historical sites, and to work with our colleagues in our office there. I had previously visited India, but never before with my current company. So this was my first opportunity to meet some of my colleagues in that office.</p>
<p>I was able to travel together with the product manager working with my team. When we arrived, we found a meeting room marked for our use. There were a few meetings rooms set off of a main room where the bulk of the office employees sat to work. Outside of the main room was a moderately sized area with a reception desk, couches, a gavel table, an eating table, and a food preparation area.</p>
<p>We found that while people were in the working room, a sense of quiet prevailed. If anyone spoke, it was in hushed tones. People were not antisocial—many conversations took place, but always in the outer room. On a few mornings, as we arrived, trainings were occurring with most of the staff in the office. During these trainings, some people were quietly working at their desks, but most were engaged in the training. So we saw that in general, either everyone was engaged in a social activity, or they were all quietly working.</p>
<p>While I worked in this environment, I found it highly conducive to <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">deep work</a>. It was much easier to be productive when people were not regularly interrupting or distracting with loud conversations. No one ever said anything or asked anyone else to be quiet. There was no need. Everyone seemed to already understand the environment they wanted to create, and even as intruding visitors, we could immediately sense the proper behavior, and acted accordingly.seemed to already understand the environment they wanted to create, and even add intruding visitors, we could immediately sense the proper behavior, and acted accordingly.</p>
<p>Deep work is facilitator in different ways for different people. In my experience, for most individual contributor work, quiet periods of uninterrupted concentration is ideal. The approach taken by the employees in our India office is the best I have ever seen at mitigating the many drawbacks of cubicles or open office layouts. I hope I can find ways to emulate some of what I witnessed and create deep work opportunities for myself and my team.</p>

			 <p>One of the surprising inspirations I have found in traveling to India is the traffic. At first glance, it seems scary and chaotic, but a subtle beauty emerged as I better understood life with almost no traffic lights.</p>
<hr>
<p>India is a fascinating place. I visited Mumbai in 2008 for work and loved the experience. This past week I have spent in Hyderabad working with our Android and API teams. There are a number of things that have struck me in my time here, and I wanted to reflect more on the traffic.</p>
<p>Driving (or rather riding as I have no desire to drive here!) is an almost indescribable experience. We heard stories of other colleagues who had to cover their eyes to avoid panicking. The first couple days, my anxiety was spiking regularly. It seemed as if we were constantly within seconds of crashing into someone, and the din of the honking horns started to make my head split.</p>
<p>People seemed to have no respect for rules of the road, or stop signs, or lane markers. At every turn, cars would pile up and somehow merge five cars side by side into two lanes. Motorbikes flowed incessantly through any gaps in the cars, blocked only by rickshaws trying to do the same. On top of all the vehicular chaos, people threaded their way through the remaining spaces.</p>
<p>It was easy to criticize what we were seeing as organized and unruly. To our Western, regimented minds, the lack of structure was unsettling, even appearing barbaric. We couldn’t understand how people could function without the safe guardrails of enforced rules and regulations. The stress seemed overwhelming.</p>
<p>And then something beautiful and magical occurred.</p>
<p>As we spent more time in the traffic, patterns began to emerge. The cacophony lost its harshness as individual sounds took on new meaning. Instead of random honking, an intricate auditory signaling system became evident. Instead of barely avoided accidents, an elegant dance ebbed and flowed. At the root of what appeared to be chaos was a tranquility that nearly everyone shared along with an understanding of their mutual purpose. There was a total lack of irritation displayed.</p>
<p>The hyper-efficient part of my brain recoiled first at the perceived disorder and the inefficiency that must surely result. Every drive we took seemed to snake back and forth through the city. I finally realized that the ubiquitous u-turns and lack of traffic lights were connected, and were a feature, not a defect. Avoiding traffic lights meant that there was a continuous flow of motion. Side streets opened on to main arteries in a single direction, and regular openings for u-turns facilitated speedy course correction.</p>
<p>One fascinating aspect of the u-turns was the impact on opposing traffic. Gates or cones obstructed the outer lane to make room for turning vehicles. Instead of causing problems or congestion, traffic seamlessly merged from four cars abreast spanning the two lanes to a car and a rickshaw or a couple motorcycles squeezing through. As vehicles turned and people crossed and lanes collapsed, the people calmly adapted. There was a complete lack of frustration and selfish insistence on priority.</p>
<p>As our group of Americans came to see the beauty beneath the chaos, we realized that understanding traffic was a key to understanding the people and their culture. Harmony and cooperation vastly exceed individualism and competition.</p>
<p>As I return back to where I am more comfortable driving, I hope I can take some of the lessons I have learned from Indian traffic.</p>

			 <p>Behavior exists in the realm of time because it requires action, but mindset exists in a timeless realm of thought. We can change our mindset in a split second.</p>
<hr>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to participate in some trainings by the <a href="https://arbinger.com/home.html">Arbinger Institute</a>. These trainings were hugely impactful on me, in both a professional and personal sense. They have published a number of books that include the same basic principles, such as <a href="https://arbinger.com/Landing/LeadershipAndSelfDeception.html">Leadership and Self-Deception</a>, <a href="https://arbinger.com/Landing/AnatomyOfPeace.html">The Anatomy of Peace</a>, and <a href="https://arbinger.com/Landing/TheOutwardMindset.html">The Outward Mindset</a>. The foundational principle is that mindset drives behavior.</p>
<p>At times, it is easy for us to remain unaware of this truth. We often see problems that arise and look to address them through behavioral changes. This will never be successful in the end because any behavior can be performed with any number of mindsets.</p>
<p>In my latest training, a fascinating point was raised. One of the aspects of behavior is that it is necessarily linked with action. As such, it exists in the context of time. All action takes time, both to enact and even more to modify.</p>
<p>On the other hand, mindset exists in the context of thought. The implication of this is that time is not a factor. In the realm of thought, changes can occur instantaneously. Often, small and subtle adjustments can develop imperceptibly over time. We sometimes are completely unaware of the final nudge that pushes us to reconsider a previously held belief and change our mind. But that actual change of mind can occur in an infinitesimal moment.</p>
<p>Confusion can arise because time enters into the picture in the implementation of any mindset change. Although a shift in mind can happen instantaneously, the behavior that results from the shift will naturally occur over time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even when our mindset changes, we often fall back into previous ways of thinking. It is to be expected that we will have to make repeated efforts to change our mindset when we realize that we are no longer acting in ways consistent with our previous adjustments.</p>
<p>As we approach our lives, it is important to remember that underneath behavior sits the foundation of mindset. Our thoughts and beliefs shape us in many way, both large and small, overt and imperceptible. When we realize that our mindset needs an adjustment, we can take comfort in the fact that this change can occur in an instant, even though it could take the rest of our lives and repeated efforts to put that change into practice.</p>

<p>As we move into the new year, I have been considering new goals. I sketched new phone wallpapers to keep them in front of me. My goals are to <strong>make more mistakes</strong> and <strong>carry less</strong> to <strong>give more</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>As I <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/01/my-goals.html">wrote about last year</a>, I tried a different approach to my goals. In the past, I have often set a number of goals, as well as rules for myself to try and move myself forward and accomplish more. Last year, my goals were more simple: <strong>be intentional</strong>, <strong>be present</strong>, and <strong>be curious</strong>. After a few weeks, I sketched a wallpaper for my phone to help me remember them.</p>
<p><a href="https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/bca8e97bf6.jpg" 
   class="glightbox"
   data-gallery="715831a82d30d7907bd83d8f2e0c24b2"

  <img src ="https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/bca8e97bf6.jpg" 
       style="border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%"
       alt="2019 goals sketchnotes" 
        
  />
</a>

</p>
<p>Overall, these goals were extremely helpful for me in 2019. It was a relief to not have a series of intense goals that encouraged my sense of perfectionism. I would not say that I was perfect at my goals, but as I continued to focus on them, they were helpful to come back to again and again.</p>
<p>I have often enjoyed the changing of the year as a time for reflection and anticipation. I was writing in my journal last week as I considered the question of what my new goals would be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The one that I know that I would like to embrace this next year is make mistakes. I’ve been thinking that the phone background that I want is a nicely designed sign that says, “Here we make mistakes” so that I can carry that with me all the time.</p>
<p>As I started pondering this question, the other thing that stood out to me is to carry less. I have a tendency to carry the emotional burdens of others, and as an empath, I feel those keenly as well. Especially since I am hoping to start talking more about mental health at work, I think it is crucial that I learn how to connect with someone in their pain and not take it with me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having decided on those two goals, I started sketching some wallpapers. As I did that, I thought more about the second goal and what the purpose is. I realized that the key is that I want to be able to direct my emotional energy to my highest priorities. My natural response to someone else’s suffering is to carry the perceived injustice. And because of my OCD, I tend to ruminate on the issue, and it weighs heavily on me.</p>
<p>With that realization, I had my three goals. There is nothing magical about having three, but there is a nice symmetry to it. In many ways, they are pretty focused on my home life with my family. I want to work to make our home a safe place to make mistakes and learn together. And then I want to make sure that I reserve enough energy to devote to my family. Too often, I will come home from work exhausted because something happened that drained me. I want to fully engage at work, but not at the expense of being able to engage at home.</p>
<p>I decided this year to split up the goals between the lock screen and the home screen. As I go to turn on my phone, I will remember each time that I want to make more mistakes and become more comfortable with that. And as I start to engage more with my phone and whatever I’m trying to do with it, I want to see my family and be reminded of my priority.</p>

<p>One last word—the apps in my dock. <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/02/reorganizing-my-dock.html">Last year</a>, I improved my mental state by switching up the apps in my dock to include apps without badges. I changed it further as I <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/02/08/going-grayscale.html">took my phone grayscale</a> and tried to focus more on creation than consumption. Going into this year, I made further adjustments. I have the apps Calm, Things, iA Writer, and Day One now in my dock. I’ve adjusted the badges so that I rarely have anything show in my dock in order to pay more attention when I do. All of these apps help to focus me on the actions that I want to be taking with my phone.</p>
<p>I am excited for 2020. I hope to continue the great momentum of the last few months, especially in raising awareness and decreasing stigma around mental health. Hopefully I can leave some of the really hard parts of 2019 behind and just enjoy the lessons learned and the ways in which I have grown. Here’s to a great year! 🎊</p>

			 <p>The traditional holiday season can be full of joy, but also sorrow and heartache. Even for those who do not struggle with mental illnesses, there are many reasons that could cause this time of year to be difficult.</p>
<hr>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/11/21/promoting-mental-wellness.html">last week</a>, we had the opportunity to spend some time with our IT department on mental health and wellness. A number of people asked for the slides, and I sent a PDF out right before Thanksgiving. I had the thought that this was a perfect chance to remind everyone about some of the struggles that the holidays can bring.</p>
<p>I discussed with my therapist this week some anxiety around the family time. She told me that this is a common time for everyone to have an increase in anxiety, especially those who struggle with their mental health. It is important to plan ahead and have some strategies for self-care.</p>
<p>As I drafted my email, I found a <a href="https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/November-2015/Tips-for-Managing-the-Holiday-Blues">great article on the NAMI.org blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people can experience feelings of anxiety or depression during the holiday season. People who already live with a mental health condition should take extra care to tend to their overall health and wellness during this time.</p>
<p>Extra stress, unrealistic expectations or even sentimental memories that accompany the season can be a catalyst for the holiday blues. Some can be at risk for feelings of loneliness, sadness, fatigue, tension and a sense of loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever your mental state, or that of those around you, this time of year is a great time for extra compassion and sensitivity. Not everyone loves to celebrate the holidays, but we all could use someone who cares for us.</p>

			 <p>I was intrigued by this article by Fiona Voss: <a href="http://fionavoss.blog/2019/11/24/running-a-retro/">My favorite way to run a retro</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The leader sets up the Trello board with four columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Celebrations</li>
<li>Gripes</li>
<li>Topics to discuss</li>
<li>Actions</li>
</ul>
<p>Then everybody has 5-10 minutes to write Trello cards in the first three columns, working from their own laptops. You’re allowed to move a card somebody else wrote from Celebrations or Gripes to Topics to Discuss if you want to talk about it.</p>
<p>When all the cards are written, use Trello voting to vote on cards. When voting is finished, the leader sorts the cards by number of votes (descending).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of my favorite aspects of this is how it facilitates different personalities and allows for everyone to have their voice heard. As a manager, often my biggest concern is that certain people may be marginalized and I am always looking for ways to improve our group communication. Whether the cause is unconscious bias, different thinking styles, or something else altogether, this sounds like a great approach to address the issue.</p>
<p>Fiona said this, talking about using lightning rounds to address an issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who want to be heard, but have trouble jumping in to unstructured group discussions, get a turn to speak without having to fight for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many people, developers in particular, think better when given a few quiet minutes on their own, and then the nudge to write out their thoughts. There are others who think better out loud. In a meeting, the latter group tends to overpower the former, and I love this simple approach to balance things out.</p>
<p>I look forward to trying this approach on my team. It is always an exciting challenge to pursue the delicate balance between too rigid structure and not enough structure to allow people to truly thrive.</p>

			 <p>As I finished reading this article this morning, I said out loud, “That was beautiful!” And then I thought maybe I could share it so others might have that same experience. The article is from Zen Habits: <a href="https://zenhabits.net/resistances/">Working with the Ebbs &amp; Flows of Your Resistance</a>. He points out that feeling resistance to new or good things is normal, but we can learn to work with it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It can also get stronger. But it can’t maintain its strength for long. You can breathe, stay with it, wait it out. Bring curiosity to it. Give the feeling a little compassion and kindness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key is develop more mindfulness. Instead of shying away from hard thoughts or feelings, sink into them for a moment and get to know them better. Over time, as we become more comfortable with them, we can notice them and acknowledge the message they are sending us and them make our own choice about what to do.</p>

			 <p>One of my most satisfying accomplishments lately was participating in a department meeting yesterday where we were able to spend half an hour discussing mental health. I wanted to pause and reflect on the journey to make that happen.</p>
<hr>
<p>As I have <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/categories/mental-health/">written about before</a>, the last year and a half has been significant in my own mental health journey. As I returned back to to work full-time at the beginning of this summer, following intensive treatment for my OCD, I found myself having many conversations around mental health. At the beginning of September, I sent the following email to my manager and our CIO:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I have been more open with my mental health struggles, I have had a number of interesting conversations with people in IT about OCD and other mental health challenges. I wanted to suggest to you that we do something of an overview of mental health and related issues for all of IT. It would be great for people to know about some of the more common disorders and challenges, and what they mean, and how to support people who are working with those. I think there are a lot of misconceptions about things like bipolar, or OCD, or even ADD/ADHD.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to tell you what needs to be done, or how to do it, but I wanted to share the suggestion and see what you think. Thanks.</p>
<p>Ben</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This email prompted a series of meetings, which resulted in my collaborating with our company wellness leader at O.C. Tanner, along with our newly-on-site behavioral therapist. In our September monthly IT meeting, we shared a primer on mental health and gave a teaser for a longer segment we planned the next month. Because I had initiated the conversations, I was invited to come up to the front of the room, but we ran out of time for me to say anything. A couple people commented after the meeting that they appreciated me being up there as the mental health mascot for IT.</p>
<p>As we prepared for the October meeting, we discovered that we had given our therapist the wrong date, and she had a conflict. So our wellness leader and I planned to take a few minutes to share our individual stories around mental health, and again provide a teaser for more to come in November. Ironically, we ran out of time for me to share again, so reprised my role as the IT mental health mascot.</p>
<p>Finally, in our November meeting, everything aligned. We were able to take half of the hour-long meeting with all of IT. I shared a short version of my story with mental health, and the bulk of the time was our behavioral therapist sharing about mental wellness. The content appeared to be extremely well received. You could have heard a pin drop while our therapist was sharing. After the meeting, I received messages from a number of people expressing gratitude for us making this subject more prominent and accessible.</p>
<p>One of the best side effects of this process for me has been the relationships that I have developed by being open. I have become close friends with our wellness leader, as well as our behavior therapist and have enjoyed working closely with them. The kinds of conversations that occur in the context of mental health lead to much deeper connections with people than most topics. So as I talk with people, I become close to them in a remarkably short time.</p>
<p>I have learned that all of us are affected by mental illnesses, whether directly or indirectly. The more we can do to increase awareness and decrease stigma around mental health, the more people will be able to get the help that they need.</p>

			 <p>I have long nursed a secret desire to do stand-up comedy, although I have allowed my fears to hold me back from trying. I finally made the attempt as part of my OCD recovery, and enjoyed the experience.</p>
<hr>
<p>As I got close to the end of my treatment at the <a href="https://www.theocdandanxietytreatmentcenter.com/">OCD &amp; Anxiety Treatment Center</a>, I was pushing myself to do more activities in which I risked something. I have long wished that I was funny, but I have come to grips with my lack of natural humor. As I <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/04/01/not-a-comedian.html">wrote earlier this year</a>, I am not destined to become a stand-up comedian. And that’s ok. I decided that I should try stand-up comedy and risk not being the best. Since I was nearly guaranteed to not be the best, it seemed like a productive thing to risk.</p>
<p>At first, I just suggested to one of my co-workers that I could do my routine for him. He asked who else I was inviting, and I realized that inviting more people would definitely increase the risk level, which was the whole point. So I ended up inviting our entire I.T. department to come over lunch, but only about 20 people came. So the next week, I volunteered to do it again for a full department meeting. That meeting was recorded, so I have a record of my attempt. It went better than I feared, and I decided I would share the video.</p>

			 <p>This was a fantastic article on Zen Habits: <a href="https://zenhabits.net/kind-done/">How to Be Kind to Yourself &amp; Still Get Stuff Done</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he truth is, most of us are judging ourselves, beating ourselves up, looking harshly at our shortcomings and flaws, a lot of the time. It’s why we’re stressed, anxious, frustrated and disappointed so often.</p>
<p>A different path might be kindness to ourselves. When we see a flaw, we might see the beauty in it. Instead of always striving to be better, we can find gratitude for how great we already are. Instead of beating ourselves up, we can be kind to ourselves and see that we have tried our best, that we had good intentions, that we have a good heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone whose OCD manifested as a pathological compulsion to beat myself up for even the smallest infraction, I know how crippling this can be. I am certainly not perfect at being kind to myself, but even learning the skill has been life-changing.</p>
<p>I love his reminder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So here’s the rule: kindness to yourself, always. Even when you fail at the rule, be kind to yourself for failing to be kind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could all benefit from learning and practicing this skill. I hope that I will continue to work on it, and that I will be gentle with myself along the way.</p>

<p>I have always loved public speaking. For a long time, I have wanted to start speaking at conferences more often, but I could never figure out exactly the right topic. Finally, I know.</p>
<p>Last summer, I had my first personal experience with mental health, and through that process have come to learn much more about myself and people around me. Nearly all of us are affected by mental illnesses of some kind, whether directly or through someone close to us.</p>
<p>A few principles and approaches have helped me tremendously in considering my own health, and I shared my first presentation about them at a local Cocoaheads meet up.</p>
<p>We had some technical issues, so the recording of the video is in two parts, and missed a small chunk of the presentation where I describe health meters and what they are. Hopefully what’s here is still useful, and I hope to improve and deliver this talk many more times.</p>

			 <p>Life is like walking against a moving walkway. We need to regularly stop and take stock of where we are at, and whether we are still focusing on what is actually most important.</p>
<hr>
<p>In my job as a software engineering manager, there are a number of possible activities in which I can engage on a daily basis. It is easy to allow myself to coast and be reactive; just dealing with the crises that arise on any given day. The natural pull of entropy is constantly tugging at us to disrupt and distract us from our priorities.</p>
<p>One thought that I have had lately is to more regularly consider the question, “What work am I uniquely qualified to do for our team?” Particularly as the manager, it can be tempting to dive in to help with minutiae that may or may not benefit from my time and attention. Often, the most helpful approach for our team in the long-term is to delegate as much as possible so that others on the team gain more experience and comfort dealing with different issues. Ideally, as the manager, I have a unique perspective across all of the issues the team is facing, and my time will best be spent at a macro level, while trusting my team to execute on the micro level.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/08/23/experiences-over-artifacts.html">I wrote</a> about prioritizing experiences over artifacts. In general, I still think that is true. However, as a manager, my most important work is communicating with others. I <em>do</em> need to have experiences that continue to shape and define me, and I need to spend considerable amounts of time thinking, but by and large, I need to communicate my thoughts and vision to others. This means that I need to prioritize artifacts more often in my professional life. My focus needs to be on facilitating experiences for my team, and creating artifacts.</p>
<p>The other crucial part of my role is to be available to help the people on my team when they need it. I will be most effective when I am able to make them more effective, and ensure that they are not blocked in their efforts. This involves a high level of reactivity, but when planned and anticipated, it can feel more proactive. I would rather be the one running around trying to figure out some obscure piece of information from just the right person, and allow the engineers on my team to focus on delivering great software. A balance is needed here. I do not want to completely insulate them from other people in the company—I need to foster connections. But so much of the preparatory work of connections is a slog of investigative and archaeological drudgery, and I would rather save my team from that.</p>
<p>Outside of those two main activities, nearly everything I do is a distraction and is taking me away from my primary role. This is something that I want to remember better, and I know I will need to pause and reflect again many times to ensure that I am focused on the right things.</p>

<p>A month of intense reading led to rediscovered relationships with a number of old friends.</p>
<hr>
<p>At the beginning of August, I decided to pick up a series that I started when I was a teenager: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sword_of_Truth">The Sword of Truth</a> by Terry Goodkind. I have often enjoyed fantasy as a genre, and wanted to read something purely enjoyable instead of informative and educational. More than with most books, the characters of this series draw me in, and I wanted to read more to spend more time with friends that I have not seen for years.</p>
<p>One interesting phenomenon that I noticed as I got back in to these books is my tendency to lose myself. I have always loved to read, and can often get lost in a book. Stopping to eat, or sleep, or work can feel like a chore. Previously, I had never understood this part of myself. But now that I have gone through my journey of discovery and recovery with OCD, I recognized exactly what it was. In addition to the character friends I spent time with, this last month has been a close time with my old friend of OCD.</p>
<p>Now that I know how OCD feels in my life, it is easier to recognize his presence when he shows up. One of his defining characteristics is a total domination of my mind. That manifests in the cracks of my life. In every spare minute, my mind immediately jumped to my books, and in many of my spare minutes, my eyes jumped to my Kindle, or the app on my phone.</p>
<p>When I finished the first book, there was a definite sense of familiarity, as if I was returning to a comfortable state in which I had lived much of my life. As the month drew on, I realized that I was not happy with the effects this state was having on the rest of my life. I <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/07/30/toilet-reading.html">wrote recently</a> about changing my toilet time to reading instead of playing a game, but now that I was compulsively reading my books, I was just as absent from the family.</p>
<p>As I wrapped up the series, it provided a natural moment to pause and evaluate. There is a delicate balance to be struck here. On the one hand, I love reading, and enjoy losing myself in a story, completely inhabiting another world, and making new friends. On the other hand, I do not want to feed the OCD side of my brain, and want to make sure that I remain in control of deciding how to spend my time. The month of August was not a complete loss—I was able to engage in a number of important events and activities. The most monumental of those was the birth of a new baby girl in our family, which was a magical experience.</p>
<p>I feel good about where things are at right now, and hope to remember to regularly introspect and maintain balance. Living with OCD is a constant exercise in managing tension, and I expect this to continue moving forward. The more I learn about myself, the better equipped I am to make informed choices about my life.</p>

			 <p>While there are cases in which the output of an activity matters a great deal, in much of life the infinitesimal changes that occur in you matter even more.</p>
<hr>
<p>My therapist suggested a few weeks that I adopt a daily practice of writing <a href="https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/">Morning Pages</a> to help clear my mind and get in touch with the emotions I am holding in my body. As I was talking about it with my wife, she suggested that I use loose-leaf lined pages, mostly because I hate lined paper. That would help transform the act of writing my morning pages to be more of an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_therapy">exposure</a>, which is always helpful in my ongoing struggles with OCD. To increase the effectiveness of the exposure, I further decided that I would throw the pages away each day.</p>
<p>I have a hard time throwing things away, especially writing. Throughout the years, I have often taken copious notes, and rarely reviewed them. After every therapy session, I would immediately sit down in my car and write an outline of what we discussed. I finally realized one day that the urge to write these things down and keep them comes from the fear of losing or forgetting something that is important. I discussed the issue with my therapist, and she kind of laughed. She commented that she would have stopped me if I ever tried to take notes during a session. The important thing for me is not to perfectly recall everything that we discuss, but rather to internalize one or two major takeaways.</p>
<p>The first few days that I wrote my morning pages, I felt a little surge of panic as I threw them away. I slowly habituated to the perceived destruction of important information, and my brain settled down. As I did, I noticed an interesting phenomenon. Knowing that I was not going to keep the pages freed me up to write more things. I allowed myself to express whatever was going through my mind, without worrying about whether it would be valuable later or not. As I quieted the inner editor that is constantly at work, I found myself getting in better touch with my emotions. I would often just create a prompt for myself, and write, “Right now I feel” and write whatever word came to mind.</p>
<p>Through this process, I realized an important lesson. The process of change that occurs as I write out my emotions and thoughts matters so much more than the output I create. This is true in so many areas of life. As we interact with each other, we are constantly changing each other. We are the result of all of those tiny changes. If we want to be different than we are now, we merely need to repeatedly expose ourselves to different situations and influences.</p>
<p>Whether you struggle with OCD or not, I imagine at times you feel the twinge of panic that you are losing something vital. Hopefully this lesson can help you, and me, to remember what really matters more. The kind of person we become is almost always of infinitely more importance than the artifacts we create.</p>

			 <p>Switching from playing a game to reading on my phone as the default behavior on the toilet has made a world of difference.</p>
<hr>
<p>A couple weeks ago, I realized that I was spending way too much time playing a game on my phone. At the beginning of June, I had been introduced to the game and started playing in some of my spare time. As the month went on, I found myself looking for more and more opportunities to play. Every trip to the toilet, I pulled out the game, and I even started going to the bathroom when I didn’t really need to. It was getting out of control.</p>
<p>I was discussing the situation with my wife one evening. She admitted that she had gotten to the point of feeling some despair when I headed into the bathroom, knowing I would be gone for a while. For years, I had implemented a rule of no phone on the toilet. It started as a month-long Valentines Day present to my wife and she liked it so much that I kept it going. During my intensive treatment for OCD, I challenged any rules my brain had for me. That resulted in me slowly pulling my phone out more and more on the toilet until it became a habit again.</p>
<p>I decided that night to delete the game from my phone and immediately change my toilet phone habits. My goal is to keep the rule less rigid, but also influence my behavior for the better. So I committed to only using the Kindle app on my phone while on the toilet. And the effects have been striking. I have found that I spent much less time in the bathroom now. I’ve only read nonfiction so far on the toilet, and it’s been much easier to stop without getting sucked in.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In addition to spending much less time in the bathroom, the time that I have spent reading feels more productive. I no longer have a vague sense of unease that I am wasting my time addicted to a game. Basically, my family wins because I am with them more, and I win because I feel better about myself. It is surprising how much the few minutes scattered throughout the days add up to.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Over the course of a couple weeks, I was able to finish the book <em>Digital Minimalism</em>, by Cal Newport, which I had been wanting to read for a while. I am currently reading <em>The Art of Gathering</em>, by Priya Parker.</p>
<p>One of the biggest lessons that I have taken from this is the importance of analyzing my life and reclaiming time that I feel is being frittered away. This is in line with my <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/01/my-goals.html">2019 goals</a>, which include <strong>being intentional</strong>. Small amounts of time consistently spent quickly add up to significant investments that can bring joy and fulfillment.</p>

			 <p>As is often the case, seeing a diverse group of people come together helped me remember what is truly important.</p>
<hr>
<p>At my company, <a href="https://www.octanner.com">O.C. Tanner</a>, we celebrate select work anniversaries with a small ceremony involving multiple speakers who highlight achievements or qualities of the employee. Today was the one-year anniversary of a man who is about to become my new product manager, and I was touched.</p>
<p>Beyond the kind words that were said about him, one fact that spoke volumes of him was the crowd that gathered. Not just the number of people, although that was impressive in its own right. What jumped out at me the most was the makeup of the group. There were so many people from different departments who came to celebrate with him. It was one of the first times I have seen that kind of audience at a one-year anniversary.</p>
<p>The specific group that impressed me with their attendance was our client success team. Many people in our product/technology department work with client success as little as possible. As they said themselves during the ceremony, they are often needy and demanding, reflecting the concerns of the clients they represent. We have a tendency to focus on the new and exciting, and have a harder time embracing the value of maintenance and enhancement, and those whose lives focus on maintenance are often perceived as less valuable.</p>
<p>I left the anniversary celebration inspired. I just passed my four-year mark, which does not have a formal ceremony. As I think about my five-year anniversary next year, I want to approach that with intentionality. Obviously, I cannot control who will choose to come or not. But the more people with whom I work and get close, the more diverse the audience can be. I have realized that the people with whom I work are some of the most important and valuable opportunities for learning and growth that I have. I hope that I can remember that over my next year, and throughout my career.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then one day, for reasons unknown, I suddenly saw the open printer drawer not as an impertinent annoyance, but as the inescapable evidence of a simple fact: I have kids.   </p>
<p>I have kids, and kids inevitably come with some vexations. Yet they’re exactly what I want in my life, and a source of inexpressible joy. Because I have this privilege . . . I also have to accept its aggravations.</p>

			 <p>I thoroughly enjoyed the latest episode of <a href="http://revisionisthistory.com/">Revisionist History</a> from Malcolm Gladwell to celebrate Independence Day. He expanded the story of our nation’s independence, particularly the Boston Tea Party. Many of the Sons of Liberty were part of a smuggling organization providing tea to early colonialists that didn’t go through England, with the accompanying taxes.</p>
<p>I have to admit that framing them as drug lords defending their turf strikes me as a bit sensationalist. On the one hand, you have people trying to get their own legitimate products at a cheaper price by buying direct. On the other, people who are knowingly dealing in death and destruction. It’s hard for me to compare the two. I think the consequences of the drug in question matter a great deal to the morality of the issue. The fact that the early American patriots also protected their own business interests does not lessen their moral stand in my mind.</p>
<p>That being said, I love the additional perspective his research provided. I laughed out loud a number of times in listening to this episode. I am sharing a clip of one of my favorite segments to give you a taste. I highly recommend you listen to the whole episode.

			 <p>As much as I learn the skill of self-compassion, it is so far outside of my natural response that I still feel like an awkward novice.</p>
<hr>
<p>I had a rough morning. In many ways, it wasn’t all that bad, but it rocked me a bit. I got up and rushed away from the family on my holiday for a therapy appointment, trying to be on time. When I arrived, I found that I had received a text from my therapist ten minutes before leaving asking if we could reschedule. She commented, “I know you hate unexpected changes, can this be an exposure to reschedule? 😂😬”</p>
<p>I actually had very little problem adjusting the plan and rescheduling with her. But I was so damn mad at myself for not looking at my phone before I left. Since I am rescheduling for tomorrow, I felt guilty that I will be taking a couple hours away from the kids and my wife in addition to the hour today in travel time.</p>
<p>I called my wife and told her what had happened. She comforted me and tried to challenge some of my thinking. “If you had texted your therapist an hour before your session saying you were ill and needed to reschedule and she didn’t see it and drove in anyway, would that be her fault? Or would it still be your fault, or no one’s fault?” I thought for a minute and replied it was somewhere in between my fault and no one’s fault. She chuckled and reminded me that a little self-compassion might help here.</p>
<p>In my treatment follow-up session a couple days ago, my other therapist reminded me of the steps of self-compassion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be kind to myself</li>
<li>Remember my common humanity</li>
<li>Be mindful of what I am feeling</li>
</ol>
<p>As I thought about those steps, I felt a wave of comfort wash over me. I could tell myself, “It’s ok to be upset. It’s not wrong to be mad right now. This is hard for me, and doesn’t need to <em>not</em> be hard.” I felt able to acknowledge my part in this without beating myself up. We will just move forward and do the best we can with the next couple of days. Almost right on cue, my wife sent me more compassion in another text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Love you. Sorry it’s hard. There is no right way to do things in this situation. So there’s no failure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to record this experience so I can come back to it. I will certainly have a similar situation come up again. I hope that the more I practice, the more easily and naturally the instinct for self-compassion will come. We could all use a little more of that.</p>

			 <p>Life can quickly get overwhelming, and if you allow yourself to be paralyzed by waiting for perfection, you will miss out on many opportunities.</p>
<hr>
<p>As I have finished my OCD treatment and returned back to normal everyday living, I have found myself writing less and less. Part of the issue is the natural hustle and bustle of life. But as I step back for some introspection, the brutal truth is that I have been avoiding it. I have been waiting to have something truly meaningful to say.</p>
<p>I need to stop waiting and start writing.</p>
<p>While I was in the middle of intensive treatment, it was clear to me that I was writing to benefit my mental health. But after graduating from treatment, I was taking less time to think about myself—how I was doing and how to improve. In many ways, that is a good thing. I am going to be happiest as I seek to make other people happy. But as in all things, a balance must be achieved.</p>
<p>Deep down, I know that part of what has held me back from writing more is the feeling of shouting into the void. There is not a large reader base waiting for me to publish again, and so the pressure is less than in other areas of my life. However, throughout the course of this year, I have learned that writing is a helpful exercise for me and my mind. I do not need an audience. I am my audience. The act of processing my thoughts sufficiently to express them is healthy and productive, and requires no other validation to be worthwhile. Hopefully I can remember that.</p>

			 <p>My impressions and reactions from the announcements this morning.</p>
<hr>
<p>This was an exciting morning. I have the opportunity this week to be in San Jose with my team from work. Along with two other guys, I did not get WWDC tickets, so we are enjoying AltConf and Layers instead.</p>
<p>The thing that struck me most was the inclusion of SwiftUI in the keynote. I am thrilled that it exists, and I love that it got so much stage time. It felt like a portion of the State of the Union got picked up and plopped in a few hours earlier.</p>
<p>Announcing SwiftUI made this keynote feel like the most developer-focused event in years.</p>
<p>As a customer, I am even more thrilled with the iPadOS announcement. When I am not in Xcode, I prefer to be on my iPad Pro, and this will solidify that even more. When the SwiftUI demo was being shown, my first thought was that it looked very similar to Swift Playgrounds, and I have a not-so-secret hope to get Xcode on the iPad this year.</p>
<p>This will be an interesting week. There are so many positive changes I can tell are coming to impact our daily developer life, and I can’t wait to learn more about them.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My thoughts and feelings for my new one-way friend, Nora McInerny, after listening to every episode of <a href="http://ttfa.org">Terrible, Thanks For Asking</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Dear Nora,</p>
<p>This is an odd letter to write. I feel like I’m writing to a close friend who doesn’t yet know that we are friends. Maybe I will start by explaining how our friendship began.</p>
<p>I had a mental breakdown that started last summer and culminated in a night at the hospital in January and nine weeks off work through March. It turns out that I have OCD, and I found a treatment center which has made a huge difference. During that journey, I found <a href="http://hilariousworld.org">The Hilarious World of Depression</a> which was a lifeline. From their website, I browsed other podcasts by APM and discovered yours. I first listened to <a href="https://www.apmpodcasts.org/ttfa/2019/03/sad-and-lucky/">Episode 65: Sad and Lucky</a>, and was hooked. I downloaded all past episodes and made my way through them over the past couple months.</p>
<p>One interesting effect of listening to you so much over a short time is being gifted a new relationship. You and I are close in age, which has always been a bit sensitive for me. I have always felt too old for my age, and with six kids and one on the way, when people ask how old I am, I have to math it. It was helpful and freeing for me to hear you own your age so matter-of-factly. I recognize that I only see what you have chosen to share publicly, but it seems that you have been authentic and vulnerable in sharing your true self. You are the kind of funny that I always wished I could be—seemingly effortless and natural.</p>
<p>Thank you for normalizing and harboring strong emotions. It would have been easy to focus only on grief, but you have welcomed all sorts of experiences into the show and given permission for all sorts of people to feel their feelings. This has helped me in my own journey toward self-compassion and mindfulness. I added your podcast to my “Funny” playlist in <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a> along with THWoD, but there were some days when I wondered if it was healthy for me to be listening to TTFA. It wasn’t always funny—it was often extremely heavy. But I found that as I opened my heart to feel some of the terrible things other people have felt, it was more open to feel what I was feeling.</p>
<p>I imagine there are days when you question whether being so open and vulnerable and honest is worth it. You have taken parts of yourself that we typically hold in reserve and put them out for all to see. I want you to know what a difference that has made in my life. I see how you have taken a defining, transformative experience and turned it into a catalyst to touch other people. The more I heal and the further I progress in my own mental health journey, the more I feel a burning desire to help other people who have suffered like I have. I don’t know what my future holds, but I draw strength and inspiration from your example and I am filled with hope and excitement.</p>
<p>Hopefully one day I can meet you, give you a hug, and thank you in person for how you have affected me. Until then, I will continue to participate in our one-way friendship.</p>
<p>Your new (but unknown) friend,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But rather than being the kind of unmanageable risk found in Russian roulette, the risk of marriage is more like that of driving a car. While you can’t 100% eliminate the chance of a crash, nobody lets that stop them from getting behind the wheel every day. Because despite the risk, that mechanical vehicle, like the vehicle of marriage, will take you places you couldn’t otherwise go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can allow risk to inhibit us, or we can allow it to help us. When we notice that something feels risky, instead of shutting down, we should recognize that this is something that is more important to us. We need to step up and engage fully and make sure that we meet the risk head on.</p>

<p>Acknowledging and welcoming emotions, even painful ones, makes it possible to process and digest them in a healthy way.</p>
<hr>
<p>I continue to have experiences that illustrate principles I am learning in my OCD treatment. I suppose that is due to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baader%E2%80%93Meinhof_effect">Baader–Meinhof effect</a>. A skill we recently discussed is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_self-regulation">emotion regulation</a>, which is essentially the ability to identify and process your emotions healthily. In the middle of learning about this, I had a situation that felt straight out of a textbook.</p>
<p>We had a meeting at work in which some news was shared that was difficult for me to handle. I asked a question, and was frustrated that the answers seemed to not align with what I really wanted to know. Later in the day, I was discussing the experience, and realized what was happening: I was angry. It struck me like a thunderclap. As soon as I realized that, a wave of anger and relief washed over me simultaneously. When I allowed myself to be angry, and validated that the experience was hard for me, I was relieved.</p>
<p>I had not realized that I was repressing my emotions until I stopped. I had been “shoulding” all over myself and invalidating my experience. I felt fear at making someone defensive, and so when they responded in a defensive way, I felt frustrated that they misunderstood me. In reality, it made sense that they were defensive, because I was upset at them for the situation. I was just denying that, even to myself.</p>
<p>Since that moment, I have continued to find that allowing myself to honestly acknowledge my emotions has permitted me to fully feel them, and then quickly move forward. I recognize that I will not always be able to do this successfully, but at least I know it is possible. It is a skill that I can improve with attention and practice. And so can you.</p>

<p>I loved this article from the Art of Manliness: <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/your-life-explained-through-dopamine/">Your Life Explained Through Dopamine</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key is to toggle between these two sets of chemicals, as appropriate — allowing yourself to be satisfied, but never wholly so; content, and yet eager for continuous growth. You have to be able to enjoy the excitement of the conquest, and be able to hold onto what you secure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understanding the function of brain chemistry has been a huge part of the last few months for me. This precarious balance is crucial to master in order to find true happiness in life. One thing that I especially appreciate is the normalization of the ebb and flow. When we understand that force, we can work with it instead of fighting against it.</p>

<p>The Calm app impressed me this weekend when I broke my streak.</p>
<hr>
<p>I <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/04/16/ninety-days-of.html">posted recently</a> about my 90 day meditation streak. Last weekend, I missed my meditation on Saturday, which I realized Sunday. Part of my OCD is an obsession for streaks, so when I found that I blew my 90+ day streak, I felt my stomach drop out of my body.</p>
<p>Part of me wanted to not even meditate on Sunday. “What was the point? I already blew it,” my mind tried to convince me. My wife pointed out that I still had the advantage of everything I learned in those 94 days—I did not lose that by breaking the streak.</p>
<p>Almost out of necessity, I took a few minutes out to meditate. When I finished, I expected the app to say something that would feel shaming because I had failed. I was pleasantly surprised to find positive encouragement instead.</p>
<p>Rather than seeing that I now had a streak of one day, I saw that I had 95 mindful days.</p>
<p>That simple choice by a product manager or designer on the <a href="https://www.calm.com">Calm app</a> team made a significant difference for me. It was a needed emotional boost on a difficult day. Whereas I had been nearly despondent at losing my streak, I became encouraged. I was reminded how much I had accomplished and not allowed to wallow in my disappointment.</p>
<p>This is a lesson I hope to remember. Whether for myself or others, I want to emphasize what truly matters.</p>

<p>A central tenet of dialectical behavioral therapy became my reality recently; I was able to embrace two apparently contradictory realities.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first weekend of April was <a href="https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/april-2019-general-conference-news-summary">General Conference</a> in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is essentially ten hours of sermons spread over five different two-hour sessions. That has always been a weekend that I have anticipated and enjoyed. It occurs every April and October, and so this was the first conference since I learned that I have OCD. Last October, I was still in the discovery phase, and did not know what I was dealing with.</p>
<p>A big part of my diagnosis is dealing with black-and-white thinking. I struggle to see a spectrum, and view the world through binary glasses. As I mentioned in my <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/26/coming-out.html">coming out story</a>, my family and religious culture growing up fed in to my black-and-thinking, and reinforced my notion of decisions being moral and absolute. I was always following either Satan or the Savior. This is something I have discussed at length with my therapist, who is of my same faith. When I complained to her about the reinforcement that I felt I received, she told me that most people who heard the same thing did not feel the same distress, and instead found it helpful to guide them as they made moral choices. The problem is not the emphasis on righteous choices, but the fact that OCD twists those teachings to mean something different to my mind.</p>
<p>Even with all of that context and preparation, I was taken off-guard with how challenging it was for me to listen to the conference talks. They are addressed to a diverse worldwide audience. I had not realized that I was having a hard time until my sister messaged me Saturday evening and asked how I was doing. When I paused to consider, I found that I was feeling overwhelmed. My sister asked if I was overwhelmed from conference or from normal family chaos. Again, I had to stop to think and found that it was a bit of both. There were a few talks that were especially challenging for me. I left things there that night and did not think about it much.</p>
<p>The next morning, I asked a couple of my kids which talk was their favorite from the previous day. I had a learning moment when my son shared that his favorite talk was precisely the one that I found the most challenging. It was a great reminder to me that most people are not going to hear the same difficult messages that I do, and will instead find hope and encouragement. Before the sessions started up again, I took a few minutes to write in my journal to process my feelings. I wanted to share an epiphany that I had.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to take a minute and try to shine some light on and reveal exactly what it was that was so hard for me yesterday. The talk that struck me as painful reinforced some of my black and white thinking around right and wrong. It seemed to say to me that I was not doing enough, or well enough, and need to be better. The thing is — that is true. I do need to do better. But I need to allow two seemingly contradictory thoughts to co-exist in my mind. I am good enough, and valuable just as I am today and I need to be and do better. In many ways, President Nelson’s talk about the importance of repentance could have been hard for me but wasn’t. Somehow, I was able to feel both feelings at the same time. I am lovable and loved right now, and I also need to and can improve and become more like Christ.</p>
<p>That dichotomy is from God. Feeling either of those feelings alone without the balancing effect of the other is not what God wants me to feel. That is <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/26/what-intrusive-thoughts.html">Fernando</a>, or even Satan himself, wants for me. The more I get to know Fernando, and how his voice sounds and feels, the more easily I will be able to detect his lopsided arguments. It is not that what he says is always untrue — it is just incomplete. God has more for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I felt an overwhelming sensation of peace and comfort as I wrote those words. I knew that God did not want me to feel shame and despair, but rather hope and encouragement. I was surprised when a talk was hard for me again later on Sunday. I thought to myself, “I already processed this, and it shouldn’t be hard anymore.” It was a good reminder that this is an ongoing process, and highly uncertain.</p>
<p>I know now that this realization does not guarantee that I will never struggle again. I will continue to see the world in black and white, and will need to pause and confront the distortions. Even more importantly, I need to cultivate the skill of holding two opposite truths and allowing them to co-exist in my mind. Life is messy, and usually non-binary. That is a struggle for me, but I am coming to accept it.</p>

<p>A reflection on my daily meditation habit over the last three months.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="my-journey">My journey</h2>
<p>Sunday, January 13 was what I hoped would be rock bottom for my mental health; I had three panic attacks and some suicidal ideation. I was tired of the struggle and the burden I felt I was on everyone else, especially my wife. Monday, January 14, I went to work with an overnight bag. I left work in the afternoon and drove to the nearest hospital with a psych ward, called my wife to let her know what I was doing, and then admitted myself for the night. The psychiatrist asked if I would be safe if I went home, and I replied that I would because my wife was there, but I was done putting it all on her, and I did not feel safe being on my own. I stayed one night, and then drove home and slept 12 hours the next night.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, January 16, I had a meeting with the VP of People &amp; Great Work (HR). Unexpectedly, I told her about my condition and situation. She was kind and supportive and I felt encouraged to keep going. That night, I had a hard time falling asleep. I decided to research which meditation app would be the right fit for me. When I was at the hospital, the psychiatrist recommended that I start meditating regularly, which I had never done before. After some research, I landed on <a href="https://www.calm.com/">Calm</a>, and that night I fell asleep to Stephen Fry reading a story about fields of lavender.</p>
<p>Since that day, I have done some kind of meditation using the Calm app every single day. A week or so ago, I realized that I had not done my daily meditation and was at risk of breaking my 80+ day streak. It is a good thing for my brain to sit with the distress of breaking a rule that it has created for me, and I almost went to bed without doing anything to intentionally break the streak. Instead, I introduced some uncertainty. I listened to a “Sleep Story” to fall asleep that night, not knowing if that would count to continue my streak or not. It did, so my streak is alive and well. This is a streak that I am more comfortable with than most because it is not so much something that I <em>must</em> do every day, as something that I <em>want</em> to do every day. If I miss a day and break the streak, I will be sad, and I will certainly feel some distress (I feel some just writing about the possibility!), but I will not be crushed.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
<p>The biggest skill that I have gained from meditation is gentleness. Because I have 90 days of <a href="http://www.tamaralevitt.com/">Tamara Levitt</a> playing in my head, encouraging me to return to the breath without judgment, when something comes up that would inspire judgment and harsh feelings, I have a sound bite to play to encourage me to be gentle with myself.</p>
<p>I have learned to accept the impermanence of experiences, particularly emotions. It is much easier to sit with an emotion when you know at a deep level that it will not last forever. This allows you to fully enjoy positive emotions, and not shy away from painful ones. I still have further to go on this road, but as my emotional self learns to trust that nothing will last forever, I am not as reliant on my intellectual self to make a rational pitch.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/01/my-goals.html">2019 goals</a> are to 1) be intentional, 2) be present, and 3) be curious. A daily meditation practice has helped with all three of these, but especially with being present. I have found myself trying to focus in the shower on the sensations of the water hitting my body, the feel of the steam, and the smell of shampoo, instead of planning for the day. I still feel like an awkward novice, but I am at least more aware of the opportunities to practice.</p>
<p>As I continue to learn to accept the present moment as it is, I find myself better able to shed expectations and the distress that often accompanies them. Instead, I am able to approach situations with curiosity. Not what <em>should</em> happen right now, but what <em>is</em> happening right now?</p>
<p>Finally, I feel that this practice has helped me to be more able to learn from my experiences. Often, we say that hindsight is 20/20 — we only understand the lessons that life offers us through reflection. As I build the skill of reflecting on the present moment, I gain the ability to notice and learn immediately. Much of my work over the past few months of treating my OCD is getting to know myself, and I am thrilled with the idea of speeding that process up.</p>
<p>Meditation may or may not be the answer in your quest for mindfulness. I have found it to be valuable in my life, and have already seen great benefits from increased mindfulness. I hope that you might as well.</p>

<p>An exploration of a template I am creating for reviews of books I read.</p>
<hr>
<p>In 2019, I have read 15 books. And yet, I have not shared any meaningful thoughts on those books. I recently finished <em>Keep Going</em>, by Austin Kleon, and <a href="https://patrickrhone.net/">Patrick Rhone</a> asked my thoughts on it. I answered him, but realized I would have rather pointed him to a thoughtful review of the book. I want to push myself to be less passive, especially with content that I consume.</p>
<p>One help for creativity is to set limits. I wanted to create a template for book reviews, to give myself a few sections to complete. Having a template is a framework that I used previously in my daily journal entries. I haven’t done that for a while, but it seemed a great fit for books.</p>
<h2 id="template">Template</h2>
<h3 id="introductionoverview">Introduction/overview</h3>
<p><em>A short, untitled section with my overall thoughts on the book. Essentially a micropost.</em></p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p><em>A synopsis of the plot or main points. Ideally spoiler-free.</em></p>
<h3 id="praise">Praise</h3>
<p><em>My favorite parts of the book, or areas I consider objective strengths.</em></p>
<h3 id="criticism">Criticism</h3>
<p><em>At least one thing I think could be improved.</em></p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>One or more of my favorite quotes pulled from the text.</em></p>
<h3 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h3>
<p><em>👍 or 👎, with a brief explanation.</em></p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>I have a hard time saying something negative about the creative output of another person. On the other hand, the feedback that I value the most about my own work is clear identification of opportunities for improvement. I am hoping that providing more nuance and context will allow me to think more critically of the books I read and form a more balanced perspective.</p>
<p>I would love to hear suggestions to improve my book review format. The main purpose of the reviews is to push me to think more about the content I consume, but I also hope that my thoughts can be helpful to others. If there are sections you would like to see added or omitted, let me know. You can reach me on Micro.blog as <a href="https://micro.blog/bennorris">@bennorris</a>, or email me at <a href="mailto:ben@bennorris.org?subject=Thoughts%20on%20your%20book%25review%20template">ben@bennorris.org</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>But when your decision doesn’t carry moral import, and you make it with all the politeness and respect possible, then you’re not responsible for how the other person deals with your choice. Whether they deal with it resiliently or not, rationally or not, generously or not, is up to them. You cannot control their reaction. And you cannot make your own decisions based on their expected response.</p>

<p>Coming to terms with unnecessary and unhealthy guilt has been a huge part of my mental health recovery process. It is vital to learn how to correctly identify your areas of responsibility and neither shirk nor stretch them.</p>

			 <p>My thoughts on and appreciation for the delightful podcast, <a href="http://hilariousworld.org">The Hilarious World of Depression</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>To John Moe and co.,</p>
<p>Thank you. The work you have done in creating and continuing THWoD is truly life-changing. I began dealing with mental health issues in the summer of 2018. I browsed the podcast directory in <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a> looking for comedy shows, and stumbled upon THWoD. Great job on the name by the way. I was drawn in, and all of my many recommendations have been met with a smile at hearing the name.</p>
<p>As I listened to guests share their stories with mental illness, I found validation. As you have mentioned many times, one of the problems with mental illness is that it convinces you that are you alone, a freak, an aberration. Hearing that others felt the same gave me a new level of self-compassion.</p>
<p>The more I listened and progressed in my journey, the more I wanted to share. I finally had the courage to write my own <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/26/coming-out.html">coming out story</a> with mental illness. I found the fear my brain fed me at sharing the personal details of my life was a lie. I received an outpouring of love and compassion, and many people shared their mental health struggles with me.</p>
<p>I recently returned to work after a couple months off for a medical leave of absence. I have tried to share personal details of my struggles with people who ask why I was out. And I have found that those conversations result in the most meaningful and authentic bonding experiences I have had at work.</p>
<p>THWoD continues to be a major part of my life. I tell almost everyone it is my favorite podcast right now. My kids were intrigued and perplexed when I told them about it. “Uh, Dad, I don’t think depression is very hilarious…”</p>
<p>It is clear this is a labor of love. You truly care about what you are creating and the impact it has in the world. John, I’m sure that it takes a toll on you to invest yourself in connecting with the darkest parts of people’s lives. I want you to know what a difference the show has made for me.</p>
<p>Here are some of my favorite moments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning that good psychiatrists exist and are worth finding</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/26/what-intrusive-thoughts.html">Discovering Fernando</a>, my very own “Steve”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/26/this-episode-was.html">Connecting with John Green</a> and knowing he shared my diagnosis of OCD well before it came out in the interview</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/02/11/playing-through-injuries.html">Realizing how asinine it is to believe we do our best work while mentally tortured</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/04/01/not-a-comedian.html">Accepting myself as I am without being a comedian</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bennorris.org/2019/03/11/just-finished-season.html">Finishing all back episodes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you again, and I wish you all the best as you continue your own mental health journey.</p>

<p>It’s ok that I’m not that funny. Just because I’ve listened to comedians on THWoD doesn’t mean I have to be one.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve mentioned a few times, and will again, that my current favorite podcast is <a href="http://hilariousworld.org">The Hilarious World of Depression</a>. Many of the guests have been comedians and have talked about dealing with their mental health through comedy.</p>
<p>The more I listened to comedians grappling with their mental health, the more I thought I should become a comedian too. I even told my wife that was my new life plan—to do stand-up comedy. It seemed like the logical next step. There was only one problem.</p>
<p>I’m not that funny.</p>
<p>I can get some laughs occasionally. I teach at a programming boot camp, and I often say something that is funny enough for the students to laugh. And that feeling! When I say something that connects with people, something inside me is filled I didn’t know was empty.</p>
<p>At the same time, I recognize that I am not naturally funny. My wife is, however. Without much effort, she says and writes things that make people laugh. As a child, I was never particularly funny. I knew people who were, but I was never comfortable enough with myself for that kind of attention.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean I won’t ever try stand-up. I’m intrigued by improv. There seem to be many associated benefits, and it is scary enough that I think I should give it a go.</p>
<p>The key has been coming to terms with myself as I am now and being content with that. I don’t have to reinvent myself. I also don’t need to hold myself back from exploring desires or dreams that I have. If I want to pursue comedy, I can. But I don’t have to in order to be happy with who I am. I am valuable just as I am right now.</p>

<p>A few thoughts on the process and effects of writing my first series, <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/18/what-mental-illness.html">“What mental illness feels like.”</a></p>
<hr>
<p>As I shared in the conclusion of my overview of my <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/18/what-mental-illness.html#conclusion">series on mental illness</a>, this was a learning exercise for me. This topic had been on my mind for a couple months. Part of the reason was to better understand my own experiences. In that sense, it was a resounding success.</p>
<p>Another big part of me hopes that this series can be helpful to someone. As I wrote a couple weeks ago, I have come to realize that I belong to a <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/12/the-loneliest-club.html">special society of sufferers</a>, and our membership numbers at least in the millions. There are so many people who are struggling to cope with crushing despair at learning they have a mental illness. Amidst that despair is also hope. We can learn to live well, even with mental illness as our companion.</p>
<p>Part of the power of fright is the risk of the unknown. When a topic becomes off-limits to discuss or even consider, it gains influence and momentum in our lives. We need to tear open the shutters and let in some daylight to see what we are actually facing. Mental illness festers and strengthens in darkness. When we reveal it for what it really is, we come to see that, yes, it is scary, but it is also faceable. Just as the prophet-poet Isaiah said of the devil,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us? How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lds.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/14?id=p10,p12,p16-p17#p10">Isaiah 14:10,12,16-17</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we become more comfortable talking about uncomfortable things, those topics can metamorphose. We will probably continue to handle them gently, but we <em>can</em> handle them. One of the first skills that mental illness often steals is that of self-compassion. And so we need to borrow and learn compassion from others.</p>
<p>I loved the experience of exploring a topic in great depth over a series of posts, and look forward to the opportunity to do it again. In the meantime, I plan to continue posting regularly about <a href="https://bennorris.org/categories/mental-health">mental health (💮)</a>, as well as other thoughts and feelings I have. I would be thrilled to hear from you with suggestions for future series, or thoughts on what has been helpful for you, or just about anything else.

<p>Having intrusive thoughts come in my mind is like having a terrible friend who keeps suggesting that I do ridiculous things. It can be hard at times to know who is speaking, but the more I get to know this friend, the better I can detect his voice.</p>
<p><em>Note: This is part of an ongoing series on what mental illness feels like for me. Read the introduction and associated disclaimers <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/18/what-mental-illness.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I have lived with intrusive thoughts for most of my life. As I have learned more about mental illness, and specifically my diagnosis of <a href="https://iocdf.org/about-ocd/">OCD</a>, I have come to realize that these intrusive thoughts are not normal. While most people will have bizarre thoughts come into their minds, they are usually able to shrug the thoughts off as strange and move on with their lives. For me, the thoughts are more persistent and visceral and often require great effort to resist.</p>
<h2 id="jumping-for-attention">Jumping for attention</h2>
<p>There is a story from my youth that is both funny and sad, as so many things are. I am able to look back on it and laugh, even while I can see and feel the sorrow and pain it represented.</p>
<p>When I was in middle school, I decided that girls would like me more, or would at least give me more sympathy, if I was in a wheelchair. I came to the conclusion that I needed to break both legs for that to happen. I played the tuba in band, and I made plans to put my legs on the arm of the couch and smash the tuba through each of my shins. I remember so clearly thinking that the only hard thing would be doing the second leg after the first. I did not really consider how hard it would to come up with an explanation for the freak accident. I was the oldest child, and I asked my younger siblings what they would do if something happened to me while I was babysitting, and made sure they knew to call an ambulance.</p>
<p>I finally decided that the tuba was not the best option, and that instead I should jump off the roof. I thought and thought about it until I finally decided to act one day. I climbed up on the roof and jumped down to the ground while my younger siblings watched. The problem was, I could not force myself to keep my legs straight. I kept cushioning the impact. So I tried a number of times. I got it in my head that it would work better in the front yard instead of the back, so I moved there. The neighbors saw me and told my parents, and I got in big trouble. Somehow that story spread throughout my extended family, and I still get teased at times when we all get together for jumping off the roof. And I have to admit, it is pretty funny in a way.</p>
<h2 id="superpowers">Superpowers</h2>
<p>Fortunately, my recent examples that involve violence to myself have all stayed at the thought stage. I have been able to resist them. I remember a few weeks ago going for a walk around the track on the upper floor of the local rec center. While I was walking, I had the clear thought come that I should jump over the railing down to the basketball courts below.</p>
<p>There was a big difference between my urge to jump as a teenager to get attention in a wheelchair, and my urge to jump off the track. This time, I saw myself jumping off and grabbing on to the back of a basketball hoop, and jumping horizontally between the backboard and the railing and the wall as I made my way down to the floor. It was so clear that I would be able to move just like Spider-Man.</p>
<h2 id="finding-a-name">Finding a name</h2>
<p><a href="http://hilariousworld.org">The Hilarious World of Depression</a> is one of my favorite podcasts lately. There was <a href="https://www.apmpodcasts.org/thwod/2017/08/imagine-depression-as-a-person-and-describe-them/">an episode</a> where they asked listeners to describe ways in which they imagined their depression. One woman said that she given a name to her depression: Steve. This makes it much easier to respond to difficult thoughts, “No, Steve! That’s a ridiculous, horrible idea.” <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>While I was on a trip recently with my brother in Mexico, I was telling him about Steve, and that I had been thinking of something similar, but did not have a name yet. He suggested Fernando (make sure to roll and exaggerate the “r” and try for a good Mexican accent), and I laughed out loud. It felt like the perfect name because every time I say it or think it, I chuckle a little.</p>
<p>When my brother suggested the name, we were walking around the San Carlos bay, on the edge of the pier. It was so timely to get a name for my intrusive thoughts. I told him that I knew it was right, because I was using it that very moment. “No, Fernando, I should <em>not</em> push my brother into the water. That is a horrible idea!” He laughed and laughed and was glad that I was resisting that particularly intrusive thought.</p>
<h2 id="dont-feed-the-bears">Don’t feed the bears</h2>
<p>One of the challenges of having intrusive thoughts is that they are often reprehensible and cause a powerful reaction. If I am not careful, the way in which I respond to them strengthens the power that they have over my mind. I am learning to be more mindful as they come; notice them, acknowledge them, and then realize that I do not have to feed them. I can just turn away and keep living my life.</p>

<p>As I was researching the link for this episode, I found that the story was actually a reference to a previous episode that I had not yet heard.

I even discovered that the woman in the episode, <a href="https://twitter.com/brileigh85">Bri Traquair</a>, has OCD and came up with Steve as a way to deal with her intrusive thoughts.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Dealing with OCD is similar to how I imagine the Master’s experience in Dr. Who. The sound of drums is always present, although they may be soft at times and deafening at others.</p>
<p><em>Note: This is part of an ongoing series on what mental illness feels like for me. Read the introduction and associated disclaimers <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/18/what-mental-illness.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In many ways, <a href="https://iocdf.org/about-ocd/">obsessive-compulsive disorder</a> is the root of all of my mental illness, and is a topic that I expect to revisit many times. When I wrote my <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/26/coming-out.html">coming out story</a>, I identified myself as someone with OCD. This does not define me, but it is also an integral part of who I am. I have mentioned previously that I am undergoing treatment at the <a href="https://www.theocdandanxietytreatmentcenter.com/">OCD &amp; Anxiety Treatment Center</a>, which has been a fantastic experience. I wanted to capture some of my thoughts around my OCD near the beginning of my treatment, as I am sure that my perspective will change over time.</p>
<h2 id="buying-a-bag">Buying a bag</h2>
<p>A recent example serves as a good illustration of how I view my OCD, and the effect it has on me. A couple months ago, I wrote <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/02/09/splurging-on-patagonia.html">“Splurging on Patagonia gear”</a>, in which I described my experience revamping my wardrobe. Part of the impetus of that change was considering traveling and wanting to be able to travel even lighter. I took a trip with my brother down to Mexico, and packed everything in a <a href="https://www.minaal.com/products/daily-bag">21L backpack from Minaal</a>, which I loved. But while I was there, I wished at times to have a larger bag to just throw things in as I changed rooms, or to transport without packing everything carefully. I found a bag online that looked like the ideal fit for me: the <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/product/lightweight-black-hole-duffel-bag-30-liters/49070.html">Patagonia Lightweight Black Hole® Duffel 30L</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have a real weakness for bags in general, and especially bags that can become small and pack in on themselves. This seemed perfect because it could be extremely small, even to where I thought I could fit it in my backpack when it was collapsed.</p>
<p>When I returned from my trip to Mexico, this bag started to dominate my thoughts. I had already considered it for hours, finding the right bag online and looking at the specs and watching the product videos. Part of my issue was that I had no travel plans in the near future, so there was not really a reason to get the bag anytime soon. But it would not leave my mind. On some days, I would think about it occasionally, and on other days, I had a hard time thinking of anything else. If my mind was not actively engaged in something, it would slip back to this bag.</p>
<p>Part of the struggle was that I had a plan to buy it. After shopping at <a href="https://www.rei.com/">REI</a>, I had a members coupon to redeem at a certain date. I decided to use that to buy my bag when the time came. But on the day my coupon became valid, I found that they did not carry the bag I wanted. So for three days or so, I agonized over what to do. Finally, I decided that I had suffered long enough and I wanted relief and I ordered the bag straight from Patagonia. When it arrived, I found that it was actually bigger than I expected, and I am not sure if it will fit in my backpack. But I have already used it a couple of times and feel no buyer’s remorse.</p>
<h2 id="everyday-ocd">Everyday OCD</h2>
<p>The example with the bag is a little dramatic, and one that lasted much longer than most of my obsessions. My more nuanced diagnosis is Scrupulosity OCD, which feels like a fancy word for perfectionism. In many cases, including mine, scrupulosity includes a religious component, where your mind is convinced that you are offending God through many of your actions.</p>
<p>One of the real challenges with having this diagnosis is that it does not look like media-portrayed OCD. I do not have to flip the lights on and off a certain number of times, or wash my hands constantly throughout the day. (Although, to be honest, if I get something on my hands, I am often paralyzed and hold them suspended in front of me until I can wash so that I do not destroy anything.) What made this hard was that a number of mental health professionals with whom I met told me that I did not have OCD. One thing my brain craves is certainty, and so to not even know my diagnosis was excruciating.</p>
<p>In practical terms, my OCD most often manifests with my family. I spent my whole childhood anticipating two things: serving <a href="http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/topic/missionary-program">a religious service mission</a> for my church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and becoming a father. I read books and articles and prepared constantly. When I became a father, I found it was very different than I had imagined. The biggest difference was that I was not perfect at it. I frequently lost my temper, or failed to live up to some unrealistic ideal I had created for myself. And as a result, I would constantly punish myself emotionally. One time when we had three children, ages five, three, and two, I wrote in my journal that while I had sired children, I had yet to become a true father.</p>
<p>Over the course of the summer of 2018, my symptoms escalated to the point where I realized that I needed to seek help. This manifested most clearly in interactions with my wife, and sometimes my children. My emotions were very close to the surface, and when I perceived that I was failing, or disappointing them, it would often trigger a <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/22/what-physical-panic.html">physical panic attack</a>. It escalated to the point where I admitted myself to the hospital for a night. It was as if the drums had finally become too loud and too persistent to handle.</p>
<p>Fortunately, through medication and treatment, I am beginning to experience relief from my symptoms. I am learning what it will mean to live with OCD for the rest of my life. There are days when that realization is a crushing blow. But then I remember that I have already been living with it for practically my whole life. Now I will finally have some tools to manage it.</p>

<p>Mental panic attacks are the scarier version for me because they seem to come from nowhere. Often, my mind starts buzzing and filling up, even resembling the ESPN app multicast feature.  Multiple streams are playing simultaneously, but only one has audio.</p>
<p><em>Note: This is part of an ongoing series on what mental illness feels like for me. Read the introduction and associated disclaimers <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/18/what-mental-illness.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>As I wrote before, I differentiate mental panic attacks from the more common variety I experience, <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/22/what-physical-panic.html">physical panic attacks</a>. In a physical panic attack, I am usually triggered as a result of intense emotions, and I can feel it building to some extent, or at least notice warning signs. Mental panic attacks seem to strike out of the blue, and thus are more uncertain and terrifying to me.</p>
<h2 id="first-episode">First episode</h2>
<p>Even though I described them as being like an ESPN multicast in the introduction, it is not always this case for me. The first mental panic attack I experienced occurred while out on a walk with no headphones. I had been walking on a regular basis throughout the summer and fall last year, and one morning at the end of October, I was having trouble with my AirPods, so I just went walking without anything to listen to. As I neared the one mile point, I started to think that I needed to talk with my psychiatrist because my medications were not working out well. I am still not sure where my mind went, but I had the distinct thought, “I am not ok.” I decided to turn around and get straight home, even though I had planned for my walk to be longer.</p>
<p>Even later that morning, I could not remember the content of what was playing in my mind. I got to the point where the voices were shouting, and I felt completely overwhelmed. I wished that I had brought my headphones so that I would not be alone with my thoughts. I began to sing church hymns to myself as I walked, and one verse in particular stuck with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When dark clouds of trouble hang o’er us<br>
And threaten our peace to destroy,<br>
There is hope smiling brightly before us,<br>
And we know that deliv’rance is nigh.<br>
We doubt not the Lord nor his goodness.<br>
We’ve proved him in days that are past.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.com/music/library/hymns/we-thank-thee-o-god-for-a-prophet?lang=eng">We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I sang that over and over to myself until I got home and immediately crawled back in bed. My wife asked if I was ok, and my response was, “Not really.” She then asked if I could tell her about it, to which I replied, “Not yet.” She gave me a couple minutes and then told me she was scared and asked if I had gotten hurt or if I was having suicidal thoughts. I told her “No” and she just curled up to me and held me so I could fall asleep. A few hours later, she came back down and asked if I would let her in, and I was able to tell her about what had happened.</p>
<h2 id="multicast-mode">Multicast mode</h2>
<p>One of my next mental panic attacks happened a couple months ago. I got up early one morning, and was getting ready to go to the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/temples">temple</a>. I could not find the right clothes, and started to get stressed and sat down in our closet. This is from my journal that day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a couple minutes, I reached up and grabbed my robe, turned out the light, and used it as a pillow to lay down for a bit. As I was laying there, I found that my mind started going like crazy. I had a few different trains of thought going loudly at the same time, and started picturing them like the ESPN app with multiple games at once. I started with two going on, and progressed to four happening all simultaneously. In the app, you can choose which one has audio at any time, but you can watch them all at once. That’s exactly how it felt. Then I heard some of the kids get up, and felt the stress that inevitably comes from them starting to get after each other. Luckily, I feel asleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
<p>There are some similarities for me between physical and mental panic attacks. In both cases, I get to a point where I am overwhelmed by the sensations and cannot continue normally. They both exhaust me to the point where I need some recovery. They are both terrifying because I lose control of part of my body. And fortunately, the frequency of both is decreasing as I learn to manage my OCD more effectively.</p>
<p>I prefer to watch a single game at a time, whether in the ESPN app, or among the thought trains of my mind. That is not always my reality, and I am learning to not be so afraid when things do not go as I expect or intend. Moving forward, I may continue to experience mental panic attacks, but my goal is to step into them instead of recoiling and assuming the fetal position. Much of life is hard and scary, including my own mind at times. I am beginning to accept that.</p>

<p>The best analogy I have found for physical panic attacks is the Obscurus discovered by Newt Scamander. It sits dormant inside of me, ready to burst out and wreak havoc and destruction at any time.</p>
<p><em>Note: This is part of an ongoing series on what mental illness feels like for me. Read the introduction and associated disclaimers <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/18/what-mental-illness.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I have had a number of panic attacks over the past few months. There are two different flavors, or types, that I have experienced. I will cover the second type, mental panic attacks, in a later post. I think of first type as physical panic attacks. During one of those, I become physically debilitated, and essentially lose control of my faculties for a time. These are usually short in duration, typically one to three minutes or so, and then the recovery can be anywhere from half an hour to an hour.</p>
<p>As I have worked through the beginning of treatment at the <a href="https://www.theocdandanxietytreatmentcenter.com/">OCD &amp; Anxiety Treatment Center</a>, I have found out that I do not meet the criteria for panic disorder. That means that my panic attacks are a function of my OCD, which also means that as I work on managing my OCD, I have a good chance that my panic attacks will decrease in frequency and severity.</p>
<p>In the movie <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em>, we were introduced to the Obscurus creature, and its host, the Obscurial. When I watched the movie, I was struck by the similarities between Credence losing control of his Obscurus, and my experience of a physical panic attack. Physical panic attacks have always come as a result of a heightened and flooded emotional state. Often, I am dropped to the ground, even forcibly, so that I end up with bruises on my arms and knees. My breathing becomes rapid and shallow, and sometimes I am left screaming. I am usually overcome with a physical sensation of pressure and tightness. I clutch my arms and squeeze and feel as if I am holding on for dear life. When it passes, I am left completely weak, in mind and body. I feel totally exhausted.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Obscurus">Harry Potter Fandom site</a>, we read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Obscurus was the manifestation of the repressed energy of a magical child (known as an Obscurial). Described as a “dark” and “parasitic” force, an Obscurus was created when the child in question consciously attempted to repress their talent or were forced to do so through physical or psychological abuse. This energy could manifest itself as a separate entity that can erupt in violent, destructive fury.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This further solidified the connection for me. The energy inside me that bursts out during a panic attack feels just like a separate, violent, destructive entity. I often feel like I am repressing it and pushing it back down inside me. The more I fear it, the more power it has over me.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of my panic attacks have occurred at home with my family. I have made sense of this as I learn what triggers them, and come to a greater understanding of the distortions in my brain surrounding my family. I often feel a deep sense of failure when I do not live up to my unrealistic and idealistic expectations of myself. I project a lot of disappointment on others toward myself, especially on my wife. This means that at times, I can be a difficult person to live with. In a household of six children, there are ample opportunities for patience to be stretched thin, and for me to make choices that are not in line with perfect parenting. This is particularly challenging when those choices can lead me to an emotional outburst and physical panic attack.</p>
<p>I do not know what the future of the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> movies holds, and how things will go with Credence. I would like to think that he will learn how to control his Obscurus more so that he is able to live his life. That is how I see myself moving forward as well.</p>
<p>There will always (at least it feels like always at this point) be an undercurrent of risk that the beast inside of me could awaken and leave me writhing on the floor. But as I get to know it better, it loses some of its potency. And as I learn to manage my OCD more effectively, hopefully I will experience fewer and fewer attacks.</p>

<p>When depression is weighing me down, I feel like I am staring down the dark pit Rey faces on the island of <a href="https://www.starwars.com/databank/ahch-to">Ahch-To</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: This is part of an ongoing series on what mental illness feels like for me. Read the introduction and associated disclaimers <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/18/what-mental-illness.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Early in my experience with mental illness in the summer of 2018, I was trying to explain how I was feeling to my wife. I had the idea to show her a clip from <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em>. The first time Rey learned from Luke Skywalker about the Force, she saw various aspects of the island, and the balance that existed. She saw the pit on the island, and sensed the great darkness it represented. For a few seconds, her perspective was poised over the pit, looking down into the depths as it looked larger and larger.</p>
<p>My diagnosis does not include clinical depression. So when I speak of my experience with depression, it is in the context of depression associated with OCD and anxiety. Many mental illnesses are related—feeling anxious leads you to a mental state that is discouraging and feels depressive.</p>
<p>With that disclaimer, I will state that I have felt the crushing effects of depression. There have been many days since I started to grapple with these issues that I have felt that I was floating in the air above that dark pit, ready to plunge down at any moment.</p>
<p>Most of the time that I recognize the pit in my mind, it is accompanied with feelings of hopelessness. When I am staring down into the darkness, it feels like it will never end. My mind revolves around the darkness, and starts telling me that there is no light at the end, and I will never escape these feelings. Those are dark days.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the movie, the scene climaxes with a huge fountain of water spurting up through the pit like a geyser and Rey collapsing on the rocks. This seems like it would be the perfect end to one of my depressive episodes. No matter what, I know that I am going to be exhausted, and left gasping for air, either physically or mentally. But to have the sweet cleansing rush of water course through the last bits of my mind feels like the best possible outcome.</p>
<p>This cleansing purge is not always what comes to me at the end of a depressive episode. When it does come, it is often in the form of writing. I am able to process the overwhelming thoughts and feelings I am having through getting them out on the page. As I write, and read what I have written, I am able to identify destructive patterns and distorted thoughts that I can confront with compassion and truth. The reality is that things are rarely as bleak as my mind sees them. And nearly always they are more nuanced. I have a tendency to see everything in black and white, and the more that I can see in between two extremes, the healthier my mind can be.</p>
<p>The most important thing for me to remember is that any episodes, or even days, in which I am staring down the pit will come to an end. The darkness does not last forever. If you find yourself floating above a fictitious island, looking down in a dark pit, remind yourself that this, too, shall pass.</p>

<p>Anxiety for me is like the <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Arc_Reactor">arc reactor</a>, as shown in Iron Man 2. At times, it pulses and the energy it emits ebbs and flows. But it is always spreading poison throughout my body.</p>
<p><em>Note: This is part of an ongoing series on what mental illness feels like for me. Read the introduction and associated disclaimers <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/18/what-mental-illness.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>As I wrote about in my <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/26/coming-out.html">coming out story</a>, I only became aware that I was affected by mental illness in the summer of 2018. One of the first physical symptoms that I noticed was a burning in my chest. I remember so clearly the day when I realized it was present. My wife had arranged for us to have a nice date together, and we went to the carnival for the night. We had a lovely evening. I had started therapy by that point, and when I realized that there was a sensation in my chest, I felt almost betrayed by it. My thinking was that because I was in therapy and I was working to make things better, I shouldn’t be feeling this now. It felt like I was doing worse than before starting therapy. I chuckled at myself with my wife, and came to the conclusion that the feeling had been in my chest for a long time, but I had learned to ignore it. I felt worse now because I was finally becoming aware of how I was actually feeling.</p>
<p>Since that time, I have noticed the same burning sensation come and go. In religious terms, sometimes you hear of a “burning in the bosom” which is <em>not</em> what I was experiencing. I struggled for a long time to find the right analogy to help me to understand the feeling I was having. Finally, I watched <em>Iron Man 2</em> again, and saw the early arc reactor. In the movie, this is the device that gives Iron Man his power, but it is also killing him as he uses it because it is spreading poison throughout his body. It hit me that this was nearly the exact way in which I experienced anxiety. The analogy breaks down if taken too far, with the most glaring discrepancy being that I do not believe I derive my power from my anxiety.</p>
<p>Having a mental image to associate with the feeling that was sitting in my chest made it a little less scary. Instead of having a small monster inside my chest writhing and clawing to get out, there was just a small, powerful disc of energy. The disc would glow and pulsate at times, and the feeling would be stronger, and at other times it would lie dormant. But since I noticed it that day in the carnival, there has not been a single day without it.</p>
<p>The poisonous aspect resonated with me as well. When the arc reactor is powered up and emitting energy the most strongly, it is causing physical harm and side effects. The same thing happens for me. When my anxiety flares up, it often has immediate physical symptoms. I will write more about the most of extreme of those separately in <em><a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/22/what-physical-panic.html">How physical panic attacks feel</a></em>. But long before the panic strikes, my body is noticeably affected. My heart starts to race, and my breath gets more shallow, as if my chest is not capable of expanding fully. My judgment begins to be impaired, and my temper shortens. Sounds startle me much more easily. Patience wanes, and I feel as if I am losing some control of my executive functions. In many ways, this is easy to understand or explain, especially after listing a number of the symptoms. This is what happens when your brain gets in a fight-or-flight mindset, which is exactly what is happening. I am being flooded with adrenaline, and responding to threats that I perceive.</p>
<p>Learning to live with this anxiety reactor is remarkably similar to Tony Stark’s work. Left unchecked, this is going to cause serious damage to me and my life. In Tony’s case, he had to invent a completely new element to create another model of the arc reactor. I am unlikely to build a centrifuge in my basement and synthesize an element, but I am finding ways to adjust the arc reactor with which I will keep living. One of the reasons that my brain goes into fight-or-flight is that I have often taken steps to soothe my brain and address the threat, which strengthens the perceived reality of the threat. I am learning to notice the pulsing of the arc reactor, and instead of firing up my hand cannons, just breathe and acknowledge it.</p>
<p>Essentially, I am seeking to downgrade the model. I want a less powerful arc reactor. I do not think that I will ever be completely without one. But I am hopeful that I will learn to live with it more peacefully and calmly.</p>

			 <p>A series with an inside look at the effects of mental illness and the way that I have made sense of it in my life.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="introductiondisclaimers">Introduction/disclaimers</h2>
<p>For a couple months, I have wanted to write about my mental health, and the different disorders or symptoms that I have faced. I continue to improve, and am currently working in an intensive outpatient program for my OCD. In a glorious cycle, as I become better at facing my mental illness, I am able to be more objective and detached about my experience, which helps me face and handle it better. So, while I do hope that sharing my experience can be helpful for others to recognize what they may be facing, this is primarily a selfish series in which I want to better understand myself and what I’m going through.</p>
<p>This is further a selfish series because I want to capture the current state of my thoughts around mental health. I can already feel myself bending and changing in my treatment. I know that I will progress and see things, including myself, differently as I move forward. Writing my experiences now preserves this fragile part of my mind, just like a before picture. I do not know if this is a series I will revisit in the future, but I already want to read it again in six months when I am a different person.</p>
<p>My mind requires me to issue a few disclaimers. I am not a mental health care professional. Essentially, I don’t know what I’m talking about. I may mix up terminology. I will almost certainly speak about disorders and symptoms incorrectly. I come to this as a fellow traveler on the road to discovery, seeking merely to share my observations of the journey, not as a sage atop the mountain of mastery and understanding. I do not speak definitively on any of these topics. Instead, I speak highly subjectively of my experience with them. If this is triggering for you, leave it. If it is offensive to you because of how wrong I am, I apologize. Try your best to let it go. If it is helpful to you, find a way to pay it forward and extend care and compassion to people in your life. I take no responsibility for what you will do with what I say. I simply seek to share my story.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Writing this series has been a wonderful experience for me. I have found the process to be therapeutic as I confront different dark realities of my mind and shine light on them. It has also been helpful to get concrete examples to better understand what I am experiencing. When I notice certain feelings in my body, I can now recognize them more easliy. As they have become more familiar, they have lost some of their danger and mystique.</p>
<p>I mentioned in my <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/27/i-finished-my.html">microblog post</a> that this has been my best writing. As I alluded to, I mean that in a couple senses of the word. First, I feel the most proud at having written this series. It was deep and meaningful to me, and I felt vulnerable in sharing these private thoughts and experiences, and I celebrate that. This is the kind of writing I want to do more of. Second, this was immensely helpful to me to process and concretize my perceptions. I understand myself better, and feel a little more self-compassion.</p>
<p>Everyone has been or will be touched by mental illness. My hope is that we can have a more open and honest conversation about our experiences. Only in this way can we encourage the people we love (including ourselves!) to get the help that we so desperately need. I am so grateful for the support structure I am blessed to enjoy, particularly for my wife. And I hope that I can help others and pay forward some of what I have received.</p>

<p>After coming to grips with the fact that I have a mental illness, I realized that I am part of the secret society of mental health sufferers.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is sad and ironic that one of the pernicious lies of mental illness is that you are alone and different from everyone else. While there is some truth to being different than most (or maybe just some!) people, you are far from alone. There are so many other people that grapple with the same kinds of issues.</p>
<p>I have been humbled and touched by the response to my post a few weeks ago announcing my own struggles with mental health, <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/26/coming-out.html">Coming out</a>. So many people reached out with kind words and compassion. But even more than that, many people responded by sharing some of their own struggles with mental health.</p>
<p>I think it is fair to say at this point that <em>everyone</em> has been touched by mental health issues, either directly or through a loved one.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At times, I almost wish we wore a special emblem like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry">Freemasons</a> to be able to easily identify each other. I understand that this is a deeply private part of people’s lives, and many are not willing to share it openly. From my own experience, I have found so much healing in <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/02/19/relative-suffering.html">acknowledging my struggle</a> and openly sharing with others. I think we often fear stigma or backlash—I certainly did for a long time myself. But I have been met with compassion and love instead, and I relish the chance to extend that to others.</p>
<p>I want to pause and acknowledge the privilege I enjoy. As a straight white man, I have all of society behind me to fall back on. There are so many people who suffer with mental health struggles that do not have the same resources and privileges. I can only imagine what they go through.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Whether you belong to this secret society of sufferers or not, we all need understanding and compassion. I hope that we can be more comfortable sharing our struggles with each other, and when someone is vulnerable that we respond with validation and encouragement.</p>

			 <p>This never works as a parent. We can’t tell someone to do the action that represents the feeling we want them to develop.</p>
<hr>
<p>I went out on a walk a few days ago, and overhead a scuffle between a couple small children. One of them started crying, and then the dad noticed. He yelled out, “Tell him sorry right now!” I had to chuckle to myself as I continued walking. I completely understood the dad, and how easy it is to say something so unhelpful and asinine.</p>
<p>Most likely, the dad wanted the offending child to actually be sorry. He wanted the child to learn that what he had done was not acceptable, and to feel remorse. If the child had actually felt remorse, an apology would have naturally followed. As parents, we recognize how silly it is to tell our children, “Feel sorry for what you just did.” It is so much easier to focus on the action rather than the feeling, and so that is where our parenting focuses.</p>
<p>This is similar in many ways to the phenomenon I noticed a few weeks ago, and wrote about in <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/18/living-with-incompetence.html">Living with incompetence</a>. We often settle for focusing on what is easier to measure, and leave aside the more important, but more amorphous, root cause.</p>
<p>When we fall into this trap as parents, we teach our children the same behavior. They grow up learning that recognizing and feeling remorse for injuring someone else is not important, but rather the outward expression of those feelings. We don’t need to feel a certain way—we just have to act a certain way, and then we will be acceptable.</p>
<p>A better approach to this kind of situation is to stop any violence and then redirect our children’s attention to more positive actions. We ignore the inappropriate behavior as much as possible, and look for opportunities to reinforce positive behavior. Then later, we can have a discussion with the child when emotions have calmed. We can explain why the behavior was wrong, and the impact it has on other people. We don’t need to teach our children to feel remorse; instead we teach them empathy, and when they injure another, the remorse naturally follows.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the biggest problems attacking society, and especially our children, today is a lack of empathy. We have become utterly self-absorbed, and all events and actions are viewed in relation to their impact on us. We have lost the ability to put ourselves in someone else’s shoes and see how our behavior and actions might be affecting them.</p>
<p>We must first master this skill in our own lives. We have to be self-aware enough to get outside of ourselves and care more about other people. As we develop and model this behavior, we become capable of passing it on to others, especially our children. As a result, the world will be a much better place.</p>

			 <p>We often attach so many expectations and hopes to recommendations we give others that we deny them the opportunity to simply experience the moment.</p>
<hr>
<p>I recently returned from a vacation with my brother in Mexico. He was able to live in San Carlos for eight months last year, as his company has an office down there. I tagged along for a business trip of his, and we had a great time relaxing.</p>
<p>While we were there, I noticed an interesting phenomenon in myself. There were a few evenings when we watched a movie together, and they were typically ones that I recommended that he had not yet seen. I found that I had an increased level of anxiety as we watched those movies, and I was worried about whether he would like my recommendations. I wanted them to be just as great for him as they were for me.</p>
<p>Because he had lived there for a while, many of the food options we chose were recommendations from him. He wanted me to try some of his favorite spots. I projected the same kind of anxiety on him for these recommendations. I felt pressure to like the food so that he would not feel bad. I’m sure that he did feel some anxiety, but not to the level that I created in myself.</p>
<p>I realized how common this is. Almost anytime we give someone a recommendation, we get emotionally invested in it. We want so badly for the other person to have the same wonderful experience that we did. Ironically, this heightened desire often makes that enjoyment impossible.</p>
<p>The problem is that introducing additional expectations can be toxic. We take a situation which may be just fine, but by building it up to be amazing it becomes a disappointment. Even in instances when it is not a letdown, the additional stress we have introduced invariably detracts from the enjoyment everyone involved could have had.</p>
<p>We have to remember that there is no success or failure attached to recommendations. When we give a recommendation, we are offering a possibility, not a guarantee. In the best situations, we merely provide the idea for someone to do something. They may choose to do it or not. They may enjoy it or not. They may recommend it further or not.</p>
<p>If we can separate the expectations from the situation and approach the situation with curiosity, we provide a safe place for true enjoyment. The key is for us to allow each other, and even ourselves, to merely experience the moment with no judgment attached.</p>

<p>There are enough times when “How are you?” comes from someone for whom “Good to see you” is not the correct response to merit further consideration.</p>
<hr>
<p>A couple weeks ago, I shared my thoughts on the common greeting, <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/30/how-are-you.html">How are you?</a> In that article, I expressed my displeasure with this question, particularly as someone who struggles with mental health. My reply of choice was to sidestep the question and neither answer truthfully nor lie, and simply state, “Good to see you.”</p>
<p>Since that time, I have noticed a number of occasions when even this is not appropriate. One of the most common of these situations for me has occurred while shopping. Since I have been on a healing retreat the past couple weeks, I have not interacted with friends and colleagues as often. I have been surprised at how often I am still confronted with this personal question from complete strangers.</p>
<p>When I do not know the person at all, responding with, “Good to see you” is not appropriate. Partly it sounds weird, but mostly it simply is not true. Most of the time, I would be much happier if I could shop efficiently and effectively without speaking with anyone.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So I have taken a new approach in these situations. When someone greets me, “How are you?” I simply respond, “Thank you.” Often it’s followed with a question that I actually have, such as the location of a specific item.</p>
<p>I have found some interesting reactions to my “thank you” response. Most of the time, people just continue on without missing a beat. We have merely exchanged polite niceties and can now continue with our information transaction. Occasionally, an observant person will be a bit taken aback that I have not answered the question. And my favorite has been a response back of, “Fine, thanks.” There is an assumption that not only did I answer the question, but I asked a similar one in return.</p>
<p>This new approach of mine has done a couple things for me.</p>
<p>First, it has reminded me of how little people actually listen. This is hard for me to stomach, and is part of the reason I had to come up with an alternative response in the first place. What I say impacts me much more than most people with whom I interact.</p>
<p>Second, this has resolved a further point of distress. It has enabled me to move more gracefully through social interactions that might otherwise be awkward or painful.</p>
<p>This may or may not be the right approach for you to take. I encourage you to explore your responses to common situations and evaluate whether any change is needed. Most importantly, I urge you to consider no longer throwing away personal questions as greetings. Save them for the people who matter the most to you, and then care enough to get a real answer.</p>

<p>Instead of ordering the best value, order the size you actually want.</p>
<hr>
<p>I imagine that my experience is similar to yours. When I go to order food, I am mentally doing a quick calculation between the different sizes to identify the best value. If 20oz is only 50¢ more than 16oz, it is nearly impossible to order the smaller size. Even when I actually want the smaller size.</p>
<p>This leads to many different problems. Instead of being satisfied with my order, I have to choose between eating to discomfort, or grappling with the feeling of having wasted food. Often times, I will eat more than I wanted so that I am taking full advantage of the great value that I got.</p>

<p>I remember a particularly poignant example of this when eating at Smashburger one day. They were having a promotion on the Triple Double which made it even cheaper than the regular burger. I did not actually want that much meat, but I felt compelled to order the bigger burger for cheaper. My friend came behind me and ordered the same burger, but asked for only a single hamburger patty. I was struck by the brilliancy of his solution. That had never even crossed my mind.</p>

<p>As I have been on my healing retreat, I have seen a few movies in the theater. I used this as an opportunity to practice the new approach I wanted to take. It is a real challenge for me to pay $4 for a smaller bucket of popcorn, when the large is $5 and comes with a free refill. The thing is, I can never eat that much popcorn without getting sick. So I have forced myself to order the smaller size and stop worrying about the value I am missing out on. And I have enjoyed my movies much more with just the right amount of popcorn.</p>
<p>There are many situations in life when we make choices based on the perceived value of the options. Instead, we need to become more comfortable with ourselves, and more aware of our desires. And then be willing to act based on what we actually want, not what we think we should want. This is a much happier, and more comfortable, way to live.</p>

			 <p>When gratitude is trivialized too often and too thoughtlessly, we run the risk of discouraging it to the point where it stops altogether.</p>
<hr>
<p>As I have been in Mexico, I have noticed an interesting linguistic phenomenon. By far, the most common response I’ve noticed to someone expressing gratitude is, „De nada.” I’m sure there are part of the U.S. where “No problem” or “It’s nothing” are the most common responses to “Thank you” as well, so this is nothing of a cultural indictment. But it got me thinking.</p>
<p>I wrote recently about <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/02/20/trivializing-apologies.html">trivializing apologies</a>. The fact that we do that feels more explicable to me than our tendency to do the same with gratitude. With an apology, we at least might be seeking to extend mercy or uplift the other person.</p>
<p>However, when we trivialize gratitude, I think we do it thoughtlessly, even without realizing it. Just as with <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/30/how-are-you.html">personal questions masquerading as greetings</a>, we can fall into the trap of using societal niceties without considering what they actually mean, or the effect they might have.</p>
<p>Perhaps this will be easier to understand when we stop to think more about what is actually happening when someone expresses gratitude. Of course, there are thoughtless “Thank you”s bandied about, and they can muddy the waters. But typically when someone expresses appreciation, it represents a moment of vulnerability. They are self-aware enough to notice feelings of respect, admiration, or gratitude, and they are opening themselves up to expressing those emotions. It is often not easy to share our true emotions, and if sharing is not met with gentleness, it can be truly painful.</p>
<p>When we respond to appreciation with phrases such as, “Oh, it was nothing,” or, “No problem at all,” we are probably trying to be modest. We don’t want to appear conceited, and somehow believe that if we validate what the other person is saying, we will be perceived as arrogant enough to assume that what we did was important and merited thanks. When we fall into this mindset, we are being selfish and self-centered.</p>
<p>When someone thanks you, you are not the point. Not even your actions are the point. The point is the other person, and their willingness to express themselves. That ought to be welcomed and celebrated. We would be much better off if everyone was more wiling to share what truly matters to them.</p>
<p>So the next time someone appreciates you, stay in the moment for a minute. Resist the urge to think of yourself and how you might appear. Focus on that person and the feelings they are sharing. Honor and validate that sharing, and encourage it to continue.</p>

			 <p>In our efforts to reassure someone that their transgression was not overly severe, we can inadvertently trivialize the effort it took for them to apologize to us.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is not uncommon for our natural instinct to preserve harmony and avoid discomfort to emerge when someone tries to apologize. We become uncomfortable that the other person is regretting what they have done, and seek to assure them that we are not upset. As I wrote about a few weeks ago in <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/25/replacing-sorry.html">Replacing sorry</a>, we sometimes do this even when the other person is not apologizing. They say the words, “I’m sorry” and we immediately feel compelled to tell them that it’s fine.</p>
<p>This scenario plays out so frequently that it deserves more thought and introspection. I think that part of our instinct comes from a good and natural desire to not let another person take full blame when they are not completely guilty. In his wonderful book <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a></em>, Dale Carnegie tells a story of using that instinct to his benefit, and suggests that we can similar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was in for it. I knew it. So I didn’t wait until the policeman started talking. I beat him to it. I said: “Officer, you’ve caught me red-handed. I’m guilty. I have no alibis, no excuses.“</p>
<p>That policeman, being human, wanted a feeling of importance; so when I began to condemn myself, the only way he could nourish his self-esteem was to take the magnanimous attitude of showing mercy.</p>
<p>Instead of breaking lances with him, I admitted that he was absolutely right and I was absolutely wrong; I admitted it quickly, openly, and with enthusiasm. The affair terminated graciously in my taking his side and his taking my side.</p>
<p>When we are right, let’s try to win people gently and tactfully to our way of thinking, and when we are wrong—and that will be surprisingly often, if we are honest with ourselves—let’s admit our mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm. Not only will that technique produce astonishing results; but, believe it or not, it is a lot more fun, under the circumstances, than trying to defend oneself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another reason for our aversion to apologies is that we want to feel merciful. There are selfish and selfless tendencies at work here. We feel a noble desire to uplift the other person. We see them suffering, and want to do our part to relieve that suffering. However, too often, we are more concerned with our feelings than theirs. If someone apologizes to us, that puts us in a position of judgment and we want to feel the satisfaction that comes from extending mercy and we assume the way to achieve this is to say that the apology was unnecessary.</p>
<p>Often, we dismiss the need for an apology because we are not comfortable with sitting in the emotions that it stirs up. We do not feel willing to take ownership for our own mistakes and truly apologize for them, and so we have a hard time hearing someone else do it. Guilt is an uncomfortable companion.</p>
<p>However, this is not always the case. I had an experience this week that made me think about this more deeply. I joined my brother in Mexico for his business trip, and we were able to stay in a condo that his company owns. He was bringing tacos so we could eat lunch together. A few minutes before he was supposed to arrive, I got back from a walk and took a quick shower. Almost as soon as I got in, I heard him come in, and I regretted my decision. When I got out of the shower, I told him, “I want to apologize, and I don’t want you to trivialize it.” He was a little taken aback, and said he was ready to hear it. I told him that I was sorry I had taken a shower and cut it so close. I felt like he had made an effort to come back so we could enjoy lunch together, and I had thoughtlessly wasted some of that time. He replied that he appreciated my apology, and also felt that we had plenty of time, and was not bothered that some of it was spent with me in the shower.</p>
<p>That felt like a pretty perfect interaction.</p>
<p>A true apology is a major moment of vulnerability. When someone is willing to be that honest with themselves to recognize that they feel regret for their actions, and then are willing to put themselves out and tell someone, we should honor that. Respecting their vulnerability doesn’t mean that we have to agree with them. But if our response is dismissive, we trivialize an act that was anything but trivial. We also miss out on an opportunity for a real, human connection.</p>
<p>I hope that I can be better at admitting when I am wrong and truly apologizing, regardless of how it might be received. I also hope that I, and all of us, can be more gentle when someone is willing to be honest and vulnerable enough to apologize. If we can do that, we will encourage that behavior, and make it easier to be vulnerable in the future. And that is a good thing.</p>

			 <p>It is important to acknowledge and validate your own suffering irrespective of its intensity relative to the suffering of someone else. You don’t have to suffer the most in order to have suffered.</p>
<hr>
<p>It can be a real challenge to allow yourself to have a hard time. All too often, even in the midst of struggling, you say to yourself, “I know someone else has it worse.” While that may be true, it is not usually helpful or healthy.</p>
<p>I think that people who struggle with mental health issues are particularly prone to fall into this trap. I hear many people on my new favorite podcast, <a href="http://hilariousworld.org">The Hilarious World of Depression</a>, minimize their own struggles and say that others have a much harder time.</p>
<p>This is a cognitive distortion—a mental trap that has the effect of trivializing your experience. It actually doesn’t matter at all if someone else has suffered the same, or less, or more than you. If you are suffering, let yourself suffer. Acknowledge that it is hard. Validate your experience. Treat yourself with compassion.</p>
<p>This can be much easier to see when framed in the context of someone else, instead of yourself. Imagine this scenario. A friend comes to you and describes a situation that is causing her anxiety and stress. You listen carefully, and after she has broken down crying and shared everything with you, you respond, “I know someone who has it much worse than you. You ought to be grateful you don’t have it as bad as she.”</p>
<p>How would your friend feel in that moment? Instead of offering sympathy and compassion, you have made her feel insignificant and worthless. You have not validated her or the experience she is having.</p>
<p>When I think of this example, I have a visceral reaction. I cannot fathom doing that to someone else. And yet, I do it to myself all the time. All. The. Time.</p>
<p>My hope is that in thinking more about this, I can remember to treat myself with kindness and compassion. I urge you to do the same. We are all in such need of this.</p>

			 <p>Our societal concept of a badge of honor for having endured suffering can be detrimental and even destructive at times.</p>
<hr>
<p>As as society, we have an infatuation with suffering. I would like to think that it stems from a healthy, compassionate place. We feel intrinsically drawn to suffering, and our hearts go out to those affected. Obviously, this has been exploited in many different ways. Somewhere along the line, our perspective of the value of suffering has warped.</p>
<p>We now find ourselves in a situation where we glorify and revere people who have suffered. The problem is that, at times, these positive reinforcements create environments that foster and encourage unnecessary suffering. I wrote about one of these environments a few weeks ago: <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/23/the-plague-of.html">The plague of busyness</a>.</p>
<p>Another environment primed for this warped perspective is the world, or industry, of sports. In nearly every game you watch, you will hear either the coach, the players, or the announcers discuss the adversity someone passed through. It’s almost like we believe that victory is not possible, or perhaps not valuable, unless it comes as a result of suffering and adversity.</p>
<p>I recently finished reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning">Man’s Search for Meaning</a> by Viktor E. Frankl. I was inspired by his ability to endure great suffering, and still maintain a belief and perspective that life is valuable and worth living. Something he said feels particularly relevant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But let me make it perfectly clear that in no way is suffering necessary to find meaning. I only insist that meaning is possible even in spite of suffering—provided, certainly, that the suffering is unavoidable. If it were avoidable, however, the meaningful thing to do would be to remove its cause, be it psychological, biological or political. To suffer unnecessarily is masochistic rather than heroic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I think about my own life, I want to remove the pursuit of these badges of honor. I want to stop trying to suffer in order to legitimize my experiences or achievements. I have value just as I am. I can allow myself to feel joy whether I earned it through suffering or not. There is no “earning it.” The badges are illusory.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I served as a <a href="http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/topic/missionary-program">missionary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> in Romania for two years. During that time, we were allowed to send weekly emails, as well as periodic letters and packages to our family. We were also allowed two phone calls home per year—one on Christmas, and the other on Mother’s Day.</p>
<p>A major change to that policy was <a href="https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/missionaries-family-communication">just announced today</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Effective immediately, missionaries may communicate with their families on their weekly preparation day via text messages, online messaging, phone calls and video chat in addition to letters and emails.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My wife sent me this article, and my first reaction was that I would have struggled with this policy. Here is an example of the flexibility being introduced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We encourage missionaries to communicate with their families each week using whatever approved method missionaries decide. This may vary based on their circumstances, locations and schedules for that week. It is not expected that all missionaries will call or video chat with their parents every week. The precise manner of communication is left up to the missionary as he or she decides what will best meet their needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not sure that I would have been able to make judgment calls at that level. The official notice to leaders states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When communicating with their families, missionaries should be wise in considering the duration of phone calls and video chats. In making these decisions, they should be considerate of their companions and keep in mind the purpose of their service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of decision-making requires a level of emotional maturity that is challenging to attain. As someone with OCD, which often manifests as excessive and unhealthy guilt, I would have had an extremely hard time making those kinds of decisions. I said to my wife:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like this requires us as parents to teach our kids how to make decisions in a totally different way than I was capable of at that age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am excited to see the effect this kind of freedom will have on young people. (Missionaries from our church typically serve under the age of 25.) They are already in a formative period of life. Having the opportunity to learn the skills required for complex emotional judgment calls will be of great benefit to them. This level of ambiguity is a much more accurate reflection of the demands of real life outside of a sheltered environment such as a full-time mission.</p>
<p>I need to make sure that I become comfortable navigating these waters myself. Only then will I be able to pass these abilities on to my children.</p>

			 <p>There are many situations in life where everything is pleasant and rewarding, but getting started can still be next to impossible.</p>
<hr>
<p>I went walking in the rec center the other day. I didn’t mean to go walking—I meant to play racquetball. At 7:52am, I sent this to my wife:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I got up this morning and thought I would come play racquetball. For some reason, I thought I would miss most of the people by coming early. Ha ha ha ha. How wrong I was. I guess I will be walking today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I went around and around the tiny track, I was struck by how great it felt to be walking. There was a little discomfort if I’m being totally honest, because it was my first day going counterclockwise. But overall, it was an immensely enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>While I was walking, the thought came to me, “This is so nice! What is it that stops me from coming?” I realized that I enjoyed every part of walking except getting started. There is so much inertia to overcome, but once I do, practically everything about the experience is pleasant.</p>
<p>So much of our lives follows this same pattern. Whether it’s connecting with a good friend, any form of exercise or meditation, or creating something meaningful, the struggle is in starting. When we realize and accept that, we are able to take steps to decrease our resistance. It can be as easy as laying out exercise clothes before going to bed. Or perhaps writing the first line of a blog post before stopping for the day. Or scheduling a message to go to a friend at a more opportune time. (Shameless plug—I made an iOS app to help you schedule text messages called <a href="http://bsn.design/carrier">Carrier</a>).</p>
<p>Identify the things in your life that you enjoy doing and want to do more. Then consider how you can decrease your resistance to starting. Your future self will thank you.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The oft-lauded sports cliché to play through injuries can apply to life more generally with a broader view of “injuries.”</p>
<hr>
<p>I was listening to my new favorite podcast, <a href="http://hilariousworld.org">The Hilarious World of Depression</a>, while driving the other day and had a realization. There is a strong myth of the tortured creative. People believe that those who are creative do better when they are depressed or anxious. This is a seductive myth, because those who do not consider themselves creative can dismiss it by saying they don’t want all the baggage that comes with it. However, there is a big problem with this myth.</p>
<p>It is asinine.</p>
<p>Believing that creative people do their best when depressed or anxious is like believing that athletes perform their best when seriously injured. No one expects a basketball star to excel after he breaks his leg. They expect him to rest, get medical attention, and take the time needed to recuperate before returning to full activity. People who have mental health struggles deserve the same kind of space for recovery, as well as recognition that their condition is just as serious as physical injury.</p>
<p>Beyond the space for recovery, mental health sufferers deserve compassion and an acknowledgment of the monumental effort involved in confronting daily life. It is easy for us to recognize the effort required for someone to play through a sports injury. But mental wounds are harder to see, both the injury and its effects, and this can make them even more painful. In addition, the playing field for someone struggling with mental health is their every day life. That is the arena in which they are expected to perform, even when they should be on injured reserve.</p>
<p>When I started going to therapy, I told my therapist once about how cranky I am when I am woken up, especially in the middle of the night. To me, that meant that I was a mean and selfish and cranky person at my core. Getting woken up was essentially bypassing all of my defenses and showing my inner personality. Her response was so validating and healing. She encouraged me to consider instead how much work is required of me to interact with people throughout every single day. The fact that I can generally be a kind and patient person in spite of my brain’s instincts to snap and be irritable should inspire compassion for myself.</p>
<p>The next time someone is short with you, or seems to overact to something you might say, pause for a second. Before responding with anger, consider whether that person might be playing through injuries. Maybe she is doing the best job she can today. Maybe he really should be on the bench getting looked at by the trainer. And when you are tempted to beat yourself up because you treated people more poorly than you wanted, practice compassion for any mental injuries you might be carrying. This world can be a rough place. It is ok to admit that you are not at 100%, and make some adjustments.</p>
<p>We would all be better served by approaching our experience with curiosity instead of expectations. And when change is needed, practice compassion instead of judgment.</p>

			 <p>Our fears and doubts often prevent us from asking for seemingly small changes in our lives that have a disproportionate impact.</p>
<hr>
<p>I checked in to an Airbnb recently where I would be staying for a couple weeks. One of the first things that I noticed was that the table that was in the room seemed to be a patio table.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The top was something of a stone mosaic. It was beautiful, but had many sharp edges. I wasn’t in danger of being cut, but I certainly wasn’t about to put my iPad on it for any kind of drawing. I often move the iPad around, rotating it to the right angle, and I had visions of huge scratches and gashes on the back.</p>
<p>I called the host and left a message asking if they had a different kind of table I could have. A couple days later, I came home in the afternoon, and found a nice, large plastic table in the room. I moved it into place, and have been enjoying it since. The left chair is for meditation and study, and the right chair is for writing and sketching.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This experience made me think about how often in life I want a small adjustment, but allow fears or doubts to hold me back from making the change. Often I listen to the voices in my mind that say it won’t work, or it’s not possible, or it would be too much of an inconvenience to someone else. The truth is that it is often possible, and rarely hurts to ask. Most people are happy to improve someone else’s life, even at the cost of a small inconvenience.</p>
<p>So to you, reader, and to my future self, I say, have courage. Be willing to make the call and ask for the table. You never know when it might be waiting for you when you get home.</p>

			 <p>Giving myself permission to get a few nice things has resulted in a desire to clean house and be more minimalistic. Also, spending time researching Patagonia products had a surprisingly uplifting effect on me.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have always loved small things. And things that collapse. And things that fold in on themselves. And expensive things. It can be a problem at times.</p>
<p>My expensive tastes combined with my OCD have posed challenges for me. When I get into my mind that I want to own something, it becomes a compulsion that can only be satisfied by purchasing the item. Making use of the item is often not required—I just have to own it. Before the iPad came out, I owned a number of digital clipboards that became abandoned in the closet, sometimes directly after being purchased.</p>
<p>I have always felt guilty for this part of my personality. Growing up, my favorite toys were <a href="https://playmobil.com">Playmobil</a>, which were pretty expensive for a city parks &amp; rec soccer referee. My paychecks were often viewed in terms of how many sets of Playmo they represented. I felt like I lacked skill and ability to manage money well. And since I spent most of my adolescence looking toward and planning for becoming a father, my inability to control spending impulses was a deep point of shame.</p>
<p>As I have gotten older, I have curbed some of my need to buy new things. It’s not completely gone, but it has become less of a problem. Part of that is because many of the things that I really want are cost-prohibitive to buy on impulse. Another part is that I simply already own most of what I want.</p>
<p>In one of my recent sessions, my therapist told me that at any given time in life, I will have to choose between spending money, health, and time. Prudence is usually required to make wise allocations of relatively equal capacities of those resources. However, there are times in life when we have “excess capacity” in one of those areas. Typically that occurs when there is a serious deficit in one or two of the others. Right now, due to my health being abysmally low, I definitely have more money than health. So I’ve given myself permission to buy some things that I want.</p>
<p>My shopping spree began when <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/24/ultralight-by-leo.html">I read</a> <a href="https://zenhabits.net/ultralight-ebook/">Ultralight by Leo Babauta</a> a couple weeks ago. I announced to my wife, “Good news! I’m going to be a minimalist. I just need to spend $1000 or so and then I’m ready to get started!” When I told my therapist I wanted to become a minimalist, she replied, “That’s nice. Not now. Your brain is not healthy enough to make those kinds of decisions yet.” She told me that I probably was making a bargain with myself in order to have permission to buy things that I wanted, and I should just buy the things without any strings attached.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p>Over the past couple days, I went to two R.E.I. stores and two Patagonia outlets. I bought a <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-micro-puff-hoody/84030.html">Micro Puff Hoody</a>, some <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-short-sleeved-nine-trails-shirt/23470.html">Nine Trails shirts</a>, a <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-capilene-cool-daily-graphic-shirt/45235.html">Capilene Daily shirt</a>, a <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-baggies-shorts-5-inch/57021.html">swimsuit</a>, a <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/product/lightweight-travel-mini-hip-pack-1-liter/49446.html">hip pack</a>, and a <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/product/lightweight-merino-performance-anklet-socks/190696744125.html">couple pairs</a> of <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/product/lightweight-merino-daily-quarter-socks/190696560008.html">socks</a>. I also went to a local sporting goods store and bought a pair of <a href="https://www.als.com/prana-brion-pant---mens/prana-pant_brion/product">prAna Brion pants</a>, and some smashable but versatile <a href="https://www.als.com/sanuk-pick-pocket-demin-shoes---mens/sanuk-shoe_pick_pocket_denim/product">Sanuk Pick Pocket shoes</a>. An unexpected bonus was that nearly everything was on sale for the end of the season. However, to be completely honest, I would have bought nearly all of those things at full price anyway.</p>
<p>Before I go any further, I have to pause and acknowledge how blessed and privileged I am. When I think about how few people in the world could decide on a whim to spend a few hundred dollars and essentially replace their entire wardrobe, I am humbled. I feel keenly the sense of responsibility that comes with that privilege. Frankly, my OCD uses that to beat me over the head and tell me how horrible I am for doing something like this. But I know that’s a lie. This is not something that I should do every weekend. But. It. Is. OK. I am not a terrible person for buying a few things that I want and that I know I will use.</p>
<p>I found that as I spent time in these stores, I had a subtle shift in values. It felt so good to say that I don’t need a bag while checking out. I realized that I would throw the bag away, so it was better to just not get one. It felt even better to get a smile and encouraging nod from the salesperson who appreciated the small gesture. The more I read about each item from Patagonia, and all of the care that went into designing, sourcing, and creating it, the more I wanted to make sure that I was doing good with more of my choices. I love reading about the <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/fair-trade-certified.html">Fair Trade program</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We pay a premium for every Patagonia item that carries the Fair Trade Certified™ label. That extra money goes directly to the workers at the factory, and they decide how to spend it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I left the Patagonia outlet in Salt Lake City yesterday, I realized it was time for lunch, and looked around for a local restaurant, and found <a href="http://twinsunscafeslc.com">Twin Suns Cafe</a> right across the street. I had a great meal there in a fun atmosphere. My favorite part was the message on their menu:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to Twin Suns, we are thrilled that you have joined us for a wonderful meal. It is our mission to serve people a good wholesome meal at a fair price for the quality we serve.</p>
<p>It is our goal to create a place where anybody can come in for nourishment in a casual atmosphere. Hopefully you share our love for food, fantasy, and have a fabulous moment while you join us here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was fascinating to me to discover the impact that this shopping trip had on me. I wanted to own fewer, higher-quality items. I was excited to pack my backpack for my upcoming trip with my brother. I wanted to do more and have less. I wanted to be better.</p>
<p>I don’t expect this kind of effect every time I buy things for myself. But I’m certainly glad it came this time.</p>

			 <p>In my recurring review of how I am using my phone, I have decided to make some drastic changes.</p>
<hr>
<p>I started reading <a href="http://calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/">Digital Minimalism</a> by Cal Newport the other day, and last night, I came across a reference to an organization that was new to me. Time Well Spent is a movement created by the <a href="http://humanetech.com/">Center for Humane Technology</a> to help people be more intentional about their use of technology. As I looked through their site, one suggestion they made was to turn your phone grayscale, and make it easy to do so using the Accessibility Shortcut to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207025">Filter Colors</a>. A friend had done this before and advised me to do the same, so I had set up the shortcut, but rarely used it. I decided that I wanted this to be my default interaction with my phone. I will leave it on, and switch it off only intentionally, and for a short time.</p>
<p>As I thought more about the way I use my phone, I came to a few more decisions. I have found that as I write and publish more, I have begun caring more about whether people are commenting on my content. My use of Micro.blog has turned into compulsive checking and consumption. Part of the reason is that I value the interactions with real people that I have had, and I want to reply to people quickly. But, I have configured push notifications so that I will know when someone mentions me. There is no real reason for me to keep checking for mentions—it has just become habit.</p>
<p>So I decided to change the apps in my dock again. The last time I did that was at the <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/02/reorganizing-my-dock.html">beginning of the year</a>, when I chose to only have apps without badges in my dock. I have found myself opening my phone and mindlessly consuming content, which is a behavior that I want to discourage. My first <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/01/my-goals.html">goal for this year</a> is to be intentional. So I changed my dock again.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I wanted to only have apps in my dock that encourage the behavior I want to be doing most on my phone. I won’t always be meditating, podcasting, writing, or journaling when I open my phone, but having these apps in my face will be a subtle reminder. I want to use my phone more for creation than I do for consumption. When I am not creating, I want to make sure that I am being more intentional. I want to start using Spotlight to specifically search for the app I am going to use, and not just browse around on my phone looking for distraction.</p>
<p>I will see if this approach ends up being helpful or not for me. I know that what I have had in 2019 was better than 2018, but there was still room for improvement. Since that will always be the case, I expect to continue to make adjustments. This quote was from my daily meditation a few days ago, and while I might substitute “phone” for “thoughts,” this is exactly the attitude I want to cultivate.</p>

			 <p>We often embark on a journey in life expecting to do or find something specific, and come back having discovered the unexpected.</p>
<hr>
<p>I went alone to see <em>Ralph Breaks the Internet</em> recently. I enjoy the digs on Disney princesses just needing a random man to save them, the portrayal of Twitter as a tree where birds chirp the same cat picture at each other, and highlighting the toxicity of Internet comments. I especially love Ralph’s journey of self-discovery that allows him to become a better friend. One of my favorite lines comes near the end as Ralph comes to grips with Vanellope’s decision to stay in Slaughter Race.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I get it. You’ve found your dream game. That’s awesome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Quote may be a rough approximation as it is based solely on my memory of the line.)</p>
<p>That jumped out at me because it was definitely not what they were seeking. Sure, there was some heavy foreshadowing, but ostensibly they were looking for the means to restore her ability to perform her original game.</p>
<p>The parallels with my own current situation struck me.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago, at the suggestion of my boss as well as my HR leader, I decided to take an extended leave from work. In working with my therapist, I decided to go further and get an Airbnb for a few weeks. The goal is to turn this time into a healing retreat, calm the panic attacks, and hopefully help my nervous system start to stabilize. In many ways, it feels like the goal is to help restore my ability to perform my original job—programmer and manager.</p>
<p>As I have been taking a break from life responsibilities, I have found that writing and podcasting, have been incredibly therapeutic for me. It is helpful when I am feeling agitated to channel that energy into something productive. Through doing this, I have discovered that I really love writing. I have only recorded a few podcast episodes, but I have enjoyed that tremendously as well.</p>
<p>I am not necessarily feeling like I have found my dream job and that I want to change careers. But I have felt that I came intending one thing, and have discovered something else. I have long wanted to be a blogger, but have felt that I was not a good enough writer to do it seriously. As I have been writing more, almost out of necessity, I have found that I do not need to wait until I am a good writer. I can just get started. I know that that I will get better over time. And along the way, I hope that I can inspire others who have felt like they have a desire to do something more than what they are currently doing, but have held themselves back.</p>
<p>So my advice, both to my future self, and to anyone who might be reading, is to just move forward. Be willing to accidentally discover your dream game. Do not be so rigid in your plans that there is no room for serendipity. And, for goodness sakes, stop listening to the voices inside your head that claim you are not good enough. Just start.</p>

			 <p>As I <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/02/04/right-vs-left.html">posted this morning</a>, I played a racquetball match against myself on Saturday. This morning, I had a rematch.</p>
<p>Again, I thought I would just share the text chain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: Early lead for right hand. First game 11-7. It was closer than the score made it sound though.</p>
<p>Wife: I believe in you, left hand</p>
<p>Me: Holy smokes. Revenge of the left hand. 11-1. And it was up 9-0!</p>
<p>Wife: [Gif of Dwight yelling &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes!&quot;]</p>
<p>Me: And he pulls it out! Left hand in the third 11-9 to win the match. Boom!</p>
<p>Me: And now I’m sweating like crazy. Tough loss.</p>
<p>Me: 😅</p>
<p>Wife: Way to METABOLIZE</p>
<p>Me: That’s right babe!!</p>

<p>So, yeah, it was pretty epic.</p>

			 <p>The tale of an epic battle between the incumbent champion and the untested underdog. Good versus evil. Right versus <del>wrong</del> left.</p>
<hr>
<p>Actually, the story is not nearly as exciting as I made it out to be. I went to the rec center again on Saturday and played racquetball by myself. Years ago, I played in college enough to get pretty good. But, like I said, that was years ago. I played a bit on Monday, and my right arm was so sore (I am right-handed) that I thought I would try using my left arm a bit on Wednesday. I discovered I was almost just as good with my left as I was with my right. Neither was very impressive.</p>
<p>While there on Saturday, I asked a couple college-aged kids waiting outside the next court if one wanted to join me while they waited for their friends. They replied that they were about to start doubles, but they did have a question about the rules for me. As one asked the question, the other started arguing with him, and after standing there for a couple minutes while they argued, I turned and went back into my court alone.</p>
<p>After warming up a bit, I did some drills and then decided to play something of a game to make me run around more. I thought I would just include my text chain with my wife to give you the raw emotion of the situation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: My right hand just beat my left hand in racquetball 11-7. It was a pretty good game though.</p>
<p>Wife: Hahaha! How does it feel to be the best?</p>
<p>Me: Pretty sweet. Also, it was an epic comeback. Left hand was up 7-0, before right hand came back to win.</p>
<p>Wife: [Gif of Gru shouting, “That’s right!]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>10 minutes later</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: Wow, another close one. Right hand 12-10.</p>
<p>Wife: Is the left-hand going to just lay down and take it?</p>
<p>Me: Good question. It came back and was up 10-8, but choked on the serve and right hand came back to win.</p>
<p>Me: The match is over now. The court was reserved at noon, so with two games to zero, right hand wins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, yeah. Pretty intense.</p>
<p>There was a funny thing that happened while I was playing. I was in the end court, so there was no one around me, and I felt quite safe in my solitude. I began calling things out, like I might if I was really playing with someone. It started with simple things, such as, “Side out” or “Long!” on the serve. But after a bit, I got more into it. A few times, following a particularly nice serve, I exclaimed, “Whoa! Buried it!”</p>
<p>I found that I was complimenting the play of the other player. I knew that was the case, because one time I did <em>not</em> speak to the other player. Instead, it was a bit of trash talk: “Ha! Take that!” For the most part though, I was able to separate myself enough that I could give myself encouragement and compliments. That is not my typical self-talk.</p>
<p>When I was younger, one of my favorite Pixar shorts was “Geri’s game.” I could not wait until I became an old man and could go to the park and play chess against myself. I am not quite sure if my experience means that I <em>am</em> an old man, or that I did not have to become an old man in order to play against myself. Either way, it felt good to get some sincere compliments for my playing.</p>
<p>This game made me realize how much self-talk matters. Positive self-talk is a skill, and a crucial one to maintain good mental health. I want to work toward the day when I don’t have to compliment the other player to say nice things to myself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We often despair of finding success, and being noticed in a saturated field, feeling that we have to compete with everyone, and be many orders of magnitude greater. In reality, you just have to be a few degrees different to leave the masses behind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This jumped out as being directly applicable to me as an iOS developer. It can feel like the App Store is overcrowded; that there is no room to distinguish my apps. But it really doesn’t require insane amounts of investment—just a steady commitment to make great work. Of course, that’s not a business plan, but it is a means of differentiation.</p>
<p>It’s also applicable more generally right now. This week I’ve been blogging more and have started a podcast. These are both skills that I want to develop more. It is easy to allow self-doubt to creep in and discourage me from pushing forward. “I’ll never be exceptional. I’ll never make a difference.”</p>
<p>The truth is—I don’t have to be exceptional, and I don’t have to make it big. I can make a difference to one person, even myself as I clarify my own thinking. In a world over-saturated with content vying for attention, a little authenticity goes a long way.</p>

			 <p>A trip to the local rec center can bring more real-life inspiration than watching the Olympic Games.</p>
<hr>
<p>A couple days ago, I recorded a podcast episode about my experience at the rec center called <a href="https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/31/at-your-own.html">At Your Own Pace</a>. Yesterday, I took another walk around the rec center track, and wanted to share some additional thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="people-watching">People watching</h2>
<p>I noticed more about the people around me this time. Not just the people on the track, but the people played pickleball and basketball down below. The people lifting weights. The people on the stairmasters. The people on the treadmills. As I discussed in my podcast, there is huge variety in the people at the rec center. The track is pretty small, so I saw a number of these people over and over as I walked around.</p>
<h2 id="treadmill-guy">Treadmill guy</h2>
<p>My walk lasted 45 minutes, and early on, I noticed a guy running on a treadmill. I didn’t pay much attention to him at the time, but as I got close to the end of my walk I realized that he was still there. Still running. He was not particularly athletic. He was younger than I, around the same height, and a bit heavier. And he just kept running. I started to pay more attention as I made my rounds. His shirt was completely soaked with sweat—wet shoulders, wet chest, wet back. Just before I ended my walk, I saw him get off. I walked over to him, apologized for interrupting his solitude, and told him that he inspired me more than anyone else there. He was taken aback, and responded, “Me?” I confirmed and wished him a good day.</p>
<p>I shared that story because of how much it affected me. I felt some anxiety as I considered approaching him, but I felt strongly that he deserved to know what an impact he had on me. After talking to him, I felt a surge of positive emotion, and hope that he did as well. It is something I would like to feel more often.</p>
<h2 id="olympics">Olympics</h2>
<p>Growing up, the Olympics were a huge deal in my family. I remember gathering around the TV and watching all sorts of events together. Whichever events and whichever athletes my dad cheered for became critically important to my young mind. I loved the experience of watching people who had trained so diligently perform otherworldly feats that I could only dream of. I was touched by the camaraderie I saw between people of all nationalities. The Olympics inspired me.</p>
<p>As I have grown up, I see more nuance with the Olympics. They still inspire me. But now I recognize more of what’s involved. As I watch TV specials about the athletes’ childhoods, I realize how much they and their families had to sacrifice in the service of my entertainment. Obviously there is much more at play than the few seconds of entertainment that is provided. But the utter absorption into their sports required by the athletes feels like a higher and higher cost.</p>
<h2 id="relatable-inspiration">Relatable inspiration</h2>
<p>As I walked around the rec center track, I realized that I was feeling inspiration similar to what I get watching the Olympics. But there was a huge difference. I was inspired by the people at the rec center, not to dream of accomplishing the impossible, but to make small and meaningful changes. I saw myself in the treadmill guy, with just a little bit of chunk hanging out over his shorts. I saw him doing something to improve his health and his life. I saw middle-aged women on the exercise bike who were never going to be Olympic athletes, but they are going to be healthier today than they were yesterday. I saw old men with canes out on the track getting passed by everyone and continuing to walk around.</p>
<p>I saw greatness in the rec center that day. And I wanted to be better myself.</p>

			 <p>One of the fastest ways to grow is to put ourselves in situations where we are inexperienced or even incompetent.</p>
<hr>
<p>I took the opportunity the other day to join in an open <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickleball">Pickleball</a> night at the local rec center. This was my second time ever playing in my life, and while I had a great time, I commented to a friend the next day,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can only be the worst at something for so long, and then you have to leave 😉</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This feeling was most pronounced in my final game. I was paired with a fairly experienced player, against two other experienced players. I was clearly the weak link. My shots were inconsistent and my partner was not able to carry us. We ended up losing 2-11.</p>
<p>After leaving, a few lessons stuck out to me. First, recognizing that I was an inferior player made me extremely humble. I was ready and eager to accept any instruction, hint, or encouragement from other players. While I am a fairly competitive person, it is hard to get too worked up when I know from the beginning that I am likely to lose. So being the worst changed my attitude and approach.</p>
<p>You often hear the virtues of a “beginner’s mind” extolled as a way to stay open to new ideas and to be able to learn from anywhere. Having this mindset allows you to be more pliable and teachable as you recognize how much you stand to learn. When you are not only a beginner, but the only beginner amongst non-beginners, this experience is heightened considerably.</p>
<p>Finally, being the worst removes you from the dangerous grip of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">imposter syndrome</a>. This often creeps in when you start to fear that others view you as more capable than you feel, and worry that you will be discovered. When you are clearly the worst, that fear is washed away. No one thinks you are better than you are, although the reality is that you are almost certainly better than you think you are.</p>
<p>If you have the psychic resilience, regularly putting yourself in situations where you are the worst is a fantastic way to learn and grow. You will have empathy for those who are worse than you in other aspects of your life. Just make sure that in your quest to gain compassion for others, you preserve a healthy dose of compassion for yourself as well. You are going to need it.</p>

			 <p>I have come to hate this phrase as a greeting. 😡</p>
<hr>
<p>As I <a href="https://bennorris.org/2019/01/26/coming-out.html">wrote about recently</a>, I have been struggling lately with mental health challenges. This has made me more aware than ever of how often people ask a deep and probing personal question as a greeting with no thought or consideration behind it. It is an easy question to throw out, and at times an impossible one to answer.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of these deeply intimate and personal questions masquerading as greetings:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are you?</li>
<li>How’s it going?</li>
<li>How have you been?</li>
<li>How you doing?</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if the person you are greeting is not suffering in some way, although nearly everyone is, asking a personal question as a greeting is uncouth. Our socially-acceptable response is a lie, followed by an equally thoughtless question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How’s it going?</p>
<p>Fine. How are you?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If someone ever stops and truly answers the greeting question, you are taken aback. Even more so if the answer is not shallow and positive.</p>
<p>One major problem I have with these greetings is the implied level of intimacy. Who are you to ask me how I’m doing? I don’t care about you enough to give you those details! I don’t want to tell you what my life is like right now. And I sure as heckfire don’t want to have to lie to you and tell you that I’m doing well, or even fine. I am not fine! And it’s none of your business!</p>
<p>In my more calm moments, I have come up with a solution that I find elegant and simple. I merely sidestep the question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Hey, it’s good to see you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has many benefits. First off, I don’t have to confront the dilemma of divulging too many personal details or telling an outright lie. Secondly, I am more direct and honest. In nearly all cases, I really <em>am</em> glad to see the person, I just don’t want to have an intimate conversation. Finally, it’s an extremely low-effort sifting process. Those who actually care how I’m doing will appreciate my sincere words, and will return to the question they consciously intended to ask. Those who don’t care won’t even notice. To them, I exchanged one socially-acceptable greeting for another.</p>
<p>Eventually, this question won’t bother me so much. When that day comes, I pray that I will remember how much it did bother me so I can be compassionate to others who are suffering. Until then, I will continue my sidestep enough that it will come with practiced ease.</p>

			 <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Hi, I’m Ben, and I have OCD. 👋</p>
<hr>
<p>I am not gay. I am happily married to the woman of my dreams, and we have six wonderful children. My coming out is of an entirely different nature. Hopefully no one who is gay is offended at my co-opting the phrase “coming out”—it felt the most appropriate for the emotional struggle I have found in coming to terms with this huge part of my life and my identity.</p>
<p>There is no one label that defines who I am. But I have realized that having OCD <em>has</em> defined a great deal of my life to this point. It feels like a big step to be able to finally acknowledge that, both to myself and to others. So, today I am announcing that I have <a href="https://www.ocduk.org/ocd/types/">obsessive-compulsive disorder</a>, along with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder.</p>
<h2 id="having-vs-being">Having vs. being</h2>
<p>When I first starting writing this post, I wrote that I <em>am</em> OCD, but as I kept writing, it felt better to change it to say I <em>have</em> OCD. That minor change in language represents a major change in my mindset, and one that I hope to preserve, or at least to come back to again and again. This issue (or any other!) does not define me, but it is something that I carry and has shaped my experience.</p>
<h2 id="some-background">Some background</h2>
<p>I grew up a member of <a href="https://www.lds.org">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, and that continues to be an integral part of my life. Like in many Christian faiths, we were taught about faith <em>and</em> works. “Faith without works is dead” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/2?id=p26#p26">James 2:26</a>). Unfortunately, our culture, both in my church and in my family, was one of absolutes as well as black and white thinking. Every choice was righteous or evil. Every decision brought me closer to Satan or the Savior. There was no room for gray.</p>
<p>In this world, I thrived. I embraced black and white and one of my favorite scriptures was <a href="https://www.lds.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/3?id=p16#p16">Revelation 3:16</a>,  “So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.” By no means was I perfect. But I sure tried. And when I failed, I made sure that I knew it loud and clear. In many ways, I was not alone in ensuring this. When I brought a report card home with six A’s, and an A-, I knew the reception would be, “What’s wrong? Why did you get an A-?” That became the voice inside my head.</p>
<p>Unwittingly, I pushed myself harder and harder, and further and further into a dark place. Part of the problem was that not only was my behavior not seen and understood as unhealthy, but it was rewarded and reinforced. Years passed and I met an amazing woman, and somehow she agreed to marry me, and we started a family. I worked hard to be a good husband and father. More accurately put, I berated myself for every shortcoming when I was not a perfect husband or father.</p>
<h2 id="my-journey">My journey</h2>
<p>Last April, I had the good fortune to attend the <a href="http://peersconf.com/2018/">Peers Conference</a> in Austin, Texas. On the first day, we participated in breakouts that were like group therapy sessions. I shared some of my thoughts and feelings about work, and the dissatisfaction I was feeling, and the facilitator suggested that my concerns had nothing to do with work. He suggested that I find a counselor, particularly one who shared my faith and understood that part of my life. I was taken aback—counseling was not something I had ever considered before.</p>
<p>Over the summer, I began to see a chiropractor for the first time. I then experienced my first panic attack, and was referred to a fantastic therapist by my chiropractor. After the first visit, I told my wife, “It’s like speaking with a skilled friend.” My therapist saw through me and could identify so many of my smokescreens and crutches. As we ended the first session, she said (I’m paraphrasing a bit because I don’t remember her exact words), “You do not have perfectionistic tendencies as you suggested. You are a <em>violent</em> perfectionist and it is damaging you and your relationships.”</p>
<p>Part of the challenge for me was in accepting that my OCD is different than what I expected. I don’t have to turn the lights off twenty times. I don’t have to wash my hands endlessly (unless, of course, I get something on them!). One of my favorite TV shows is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk_(TV_series)">Monk</a>. I identified with so much of what he feels and says. But at the same time, I found my own situation to be so different than his that I felt sure that this is not what I have.</p>
<p>As an aside, my wife and I were in the middle of rewatching all eight seasons of Monk when I experienced my first panic attack and started seeking help, and we decided that I had better take a break until I feel less suggestible. 😂</p>
<p>As I met with a psychiatrist and started medication, I experienced the onset of panic disorder. We experimented with medication, and I am on my fourth try and finally starting to feel some relief. As my therapist has helped me see, part of the challenge with OCD is that it works…until it doesn’t. I have developed compulsions and coping mechanisms that are so ingrained that I don’t even recognize them as such yet. But the journey has begun.</p>
<h2 id="my-current-state">My current state</h2>
<p>I would like to think that I hit rock bottom a couple weeks ago. After a day with three panic attacks, and some unsafe thoughts, I admitted myself to a crisis center for a night to make sure that I was stable and safe. Since that point, I have continued to improve. I am surrounded by loving and caring people who have given me unconditional support.</p>
<p>Some days, all that support makes it worse. I told a support group this week that each new relationship feels like another chance to let someone down. But I have come to accept that.</p>
<p>The truth is that I <em>will</em> let people down. I am <em>not</em> enough. The beauty is that I don’t have to be. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is so much more important and impactful than the culture in which I grew up. I don’t have to be enough because I have a Savior who <em>is</em> enough. That teaching got lost for me somewhere along the way, and I still struggle to hold on to it. But I have hope.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>
<p>Some of my fantastic support comes from people at work. My boss and HR leader suggested that I consider taking some time off to heal, which I have done. So I am on extended leave from work. I have stepped back from my volunteer church assignment. I am getting more counseling and starting to take steps toward healing.</p>
<p>I am a long way from better. But I finally realize and accept that. It took me a while to get to this point, but I am now fine telling anyone about my situation. It is no longer a badge of shame. And it is certainly not a failure.</p>
<p>I am Ben, and I have OCD.</p>
<p>And that’s ok.</p>

		<a href="https://micro.bennorris.com/2019/01/25/replacing-sorry.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-01-25 14:21:22 -0600">Jan 25, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The phrase “I’m sorry” has so many potential meanings and applications that it is nearly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>My wife and I have worked on removing it from our conversation with each other in favor of more explicit phrases. There are two main substitutes we use instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I send you compassion”</li>
<li>“I apologize”</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the main reasons that drove us to make this change came from the compassionate style of “sorry” usage. Often, exchanges went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m sorry that happened.</p>
<p>It’s ok. It wasn’t your fault.</p>
<p>I wasn’t actually taking the blame for it.</p>
<p>Oh. Right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Usually that second speaker was me. 😆</p>
<p>After this had happened enough times, I asked if we could try to make a change so I could more easily understand with clarity.</p>
<p>I have found that a side effect of using this increased precision of language is a greater feeling of intentionality. It can be all too easy when seeing someone suffering to blithely toss an “I’m sorry” their way. Consciously stopping to say the words has helped me feel more actual compassion. I also feel a heightened sense of accountability when I wronged someone and then realize it and deliberately apologize.</p>
<p>If this has resonated with you, I invite you to join me in a practice of greater compassion and accountability through increased precision of language. I hope you find as beneficial as I have.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.bennorris.com/2019/01/23/the-plague-of.html">🌀 The plague of busyness</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://micro.bennorris.com/2019/01/23/the-plague-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-01-23 09:46:20 -0600">Jan 23, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A multitude of plagues beset us today, and one of the most pernicious is busyness. Somehow, we have allowed this to become a martyr’s badge of glory. We revel in how little time we have to ourselves as if this validates our importance, our inclusion into the elite. The few. The proud. The busy.</p>
<h2 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h2>
<p>Three ramifications of this infatuation have forced their way into my consciousness lately:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sacrificing the important on the altar of the urgent</li>
<li>Indulging in an addiction to meetings</li>
<li>Denying ourselves and others space for self-care</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sacrificial-altars">Sacrificial altars</h3>
<p>When busyness infects us, we stop planning and stop thinking. We start reacting, and are constantly overwhelmed. This leads us to prioritizing based on pain, which will always lead us to pay more attention to immediate demands. Unconsciously, every time we do this, we are plucking our important work up and dumping it unceremoniously as a sacrifice to the urgent. The gods of busyness are never appeased, and we end up living our life fighting the fires we have lit on these insatiable altars.</p>
<h3 id="addiction-indulgence">Addiction indulgence</h3>
<p>Meetings are the ultimate expression of busyness. Nothing says busy like a calendar full of meetings. We feel more and more important as we dash to and fro without pausing to think or prepare or work—we just congregate with other addicts and talk about working instead. Most meetings could have been a simple asynchronous digital conversation, but instead we crowd our calendar with evidence of our importance. Like so many other addictions, we reason to ourselves that all of these meetings are necessary—this is real work. We are having crucial discussions. And the cycle perpetuates.</p>
<h3 id="self-care-denial">Self-care denial</h3>
<p>Tragically, one of the first casualties of this plague is the opportunity for self-care. Even contemplating considering time out for renewal feels heretical. We fill our time with “shoulds” and “have-tos” in order to maximize efficiency and continuously realign our paradigms with the highest priorities, and other empty nonsense phrases. Just as with our projects, we unconsciously budget for rework and recovery due to an urgent lack of time to slow down and take a careful approach now. Absent self-care, we become the doppelgänger of our battered calendar—an exhausted husk reminiscent of potential greatness.</p>
<h2 id="remedy">Remedy</h2>
<p>The rather obvious cure for the plague of busyness is to slow down. We must acclimatize ourselves to inefficiency, and embrace occasional boredom. There must be white space in our lives and in our minds. We must consciously step out of the urgent to consider the important.</p>
<p>One practical approach to facilitate this is to simply schedule time to think. Feign conformance by using the favorite weapon of the busy elite—the calendar—to thwart their designs. When regularly practiced, this thinking time will result in drastic changes to the way in which you spend your days.</p>
<p>There is little chance of exterminating a plague that so many are eager to experience. You cannot remain completely unsoiled as you trudge through the ubiquitous infestation of the workplace and world. But you can escape the clutches of comprehensive infection. Practice constant vigilance while granting yourself permission to take life at a slower pace. Success, while never certain, is imminently attainable.</p>

			 <p>I loved this article this morning: <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sunday-firesides-dependence-to-independence/">Sunday Firesides: Dependence to Independence - The Art of Manliness</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, many people don’t outgrow this phase of infantile dependence. They still primarily try to get what they want by manipulating others, by having a “tantrum,” by metaphorically quivering their lip or pooping in their pants and then waiting for someone to notice. They wait for a solution to their problems to arrive from the outside.</p>
<p>Maturing means growing in your capability to meet your own needs, as you become progressively more skilled, competent, and emotionally intelligent. And it means becoming less needy in general. As Ralph Waldo Emerson put it, “Can anything be so elegant as to have few wants and to serve them oneself?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope to improve this in my own life, and also to equip my children with these skills as they grow up.</p>

			 <p><em>Note: I started this post last week, and then ignored the news for a few days. I thought that I would need to table this post as being no longer relevant. Sadly, I found out today that it is even more relevant than before.</em></p>
<p>I heard in the news on the radio that the government shutdown has become the longest ever. It seems that everyone involved is happy to have it drag on as long as they are able to blame someone else for it. This behavior makes me sick and a bit worried about the future.</p>
<p>It hit me that this kind of incompetence has become almost ubiquitous. We see people in positions of authority who appear to be comfortable with sitting back and looking for others to blame for their failures instead of working to create solutions.</p>
<p>One of the problems is that we have come to equate experience, or time in position, with competence. We often promote the wrong people—someone who does well as an individual contributor gets promoted and immediately starts on the management track. These people then stay in management and begin to be considered as competent just because they have management experience.</p>
<p>It seems to me that a major cause, if not the root cause, of this failure is that we skew evaluations in favor of measures that are easy to quantify. Competence is hard to measure, but years of experience is easy, so we settle for that. In order to fix the issue of living with incompetence, we need to get better at evaluating intangible behaviors.</p>
<p>As cathartic as venting can be, I want to make sure that this is not just a gripe post for me. My biggest takeaway from my thinking about this is to focus on improving my evaluation skills. As a father, and as a manager, I want to find ways to mentor and help others grow in meaningful ways. I want to make sure that I never contribute to this culture of living with incompetence, but instead work to be part of the solution.</p>

			 <p>As a father of six, I feel qualified in saying that however many kids you have, that number is hard. Take one away, and life is so much easier.</p>
<hr>
<p>We were at a friend’s house recently for games, and the topic of kids came up. They said they wanted to learn from us how to handle their four children. Their youngest is a year and a half now, and life feels overwhelming at times. They thought we would have some answers since we have been through the phase of having four children.</p>
<p>This is a situation we have encountered many times over the years. People seem to assume that because we have so many children and are still alive, we must be experts on how to parent perfectly. They seem incredulous when we sympathize with them, as if we are patronizing them with their paltry number of children. The truth is that we have found reality to be exactly what we tell them. No matter how many children you have, that number is hard to the point of being overwhelming. If even one child is removed from the situation, whether at a friend’s house, or staying with relatives, everything feels much easier to manage. Put another way, <em>n</em> number of children is hard; <em>n</em>-1 is easy.</p>
<p>Because we have so many children, this results in us saying things to each other like, “What do people <em>do</em> with only four children? This is so easy!” We try to be careful to only say this between ourselves, so that we don’t offend people who are barely getting by with their four children. In reality, we are not more any more accomplished than they—we are just conditioned to a harsher reality.</p>
<p>The human body, including our mind, has an amazing ability to adapt. We see this when we are working outside on a snowy day and find ourselves sweating despite freezing temperatures. Whatever we routinely do becomes our new normal.</p>
<p>We have to be so careful of comparing our situation to someone else’s. We have a societal obsession with comparison that almost always results in a sense of defeat and despair. We never live up to what we see in someone else, especially when we compare our unedited life with their highlight reel.</p>
<p>The most important lesson I have learned from these n-1 moments is that what is hard for me is always different from what is hard for someone else. I need to exercise compassion, both for other people as well as for myself.</p>

			 <p>I <a href="https://bennorris.org/2019/01/06/at-church-today.html">posted recently</a> an experience that I had with my son:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At church today, my six-year-old handed me a piece of his toy and asked me to fix it. After trying for just a bit, I handed it back to him. He looked at it and asked, “Daddy, did you do your best?” Then he looked up at me intently and asked again, “Did you <em>do your best</em>?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time, I laughed a bit at his intensity, but his two questions have continued to play in my mind. The second question communicates a level of challenge. It forces me to self evaluate and decide whether I really did give my best effort. It pushes me to keep going if I have the nagging suspicion that I could do more.</p>
<p>This question, by itself, is something of a double-edged sword. We all need motivation to keep going when our enthusiasm is flagging. In today’s world however, there never seems to be a lack of this kind of motivation. Everywhere we turn, there is something telling us to give 110% or to dig deep and push through. The problem comes when this starts to resonate with the voice of self-doubt and self-criticism that all of us have inside. If instead of hearing, “You should give your best effort,” we hear, “You are failing to give your best,” we are going to end up in a cycle of self-loathing and despair.</p>
<p>That is why his first question was so important. On the surface, it may seem that they were the same question. They were the same words after all. But the first question conveyed so much trust and hope. It wasn’t just, “Make sure you do your best!” It was also, “I’m sure that you did all you could. It’s ok to not complete the job all the way if you gave it all you had.” The part that was so meaningful to me as I reflected on the situation was that the trust was so automatic. His incredulity kicked in after a brief second, and he wanted to see if I just gave up or if I really did all I could. But his initial reaction felt like one of trust and acceptance.</p>
<p>As I’ve thought about this experience, I’ve wondered what life would be like if we all encountered these questions regularly. What if the first reaction to anything we did was acceptance and trust that we gave it our all, and a quiet assurance that our best is acceptable? That implied confidence makes it so much easier to face up to the second question with a straight back and square shoulders. We can look ourselves in the mirror, or look our questioner in the face, and be honest. If we have given less than our best effort, we are willing to re-engage and do more.</p>
<p>My hope is that I can provide more of those experiences to those around me, particularly those who are closest to me. My children need to feel an immediate acceptance and trust from me. They should know that they are enough. Just as they are. No changes needed. They should also know that I expect them to keep striving; to push themselves to do their absolute best. But all along the way, they are loved and accepted. And so am I.</p>

			 <p>Watching our new puppy sleep has helped me remember that sometimes people don’t need or want the help we feel compelled to offer.</p>
<hr>
<p>Our puppy seems to alternate between two modes—unbridled energy or complete lethargy. My daughter has been doing a great job of taking him out regularly and making sure that he gets the exercise that he needs, as well as ample opportunity to do his business outside. I have often come upstairs and found him asleep on the hardwood floor.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At first, this would bother me somewhat. I would feel some amount of guilt that I was making the dog sleep on something so uncomfortable when I had better options available. However, we got him a bed and put it right in the spot where he usually rests. A wider version of the same picture shows how close he is to the bed, even as he is sleeping on the floor.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I realized that I can’t force him to be more comfortable, and don’t need to take that on. If I have provided the environment, I need to step back and allow him to make his own decision. Not only does he not need the help I want to give, he doesn’t even want it. He has made his choice and I need to respect that.</p>
<p>As a parent or a manager, it is so easy to fall into this same trap. We see someone doing something that seems suboptimal or tedious, and feel like we need to step in and fix the situation. Most of the time, what the person has chosen is either the way that they like to do it, or just a natural step in their required learning progression. We need to care about people enough to give them space to make their own decisions, and then allow them to learn and grow from the natural consequences of those decisions.</p>
<p>This ties into one of my <a href="https://bennorris.org/2019/01/01/my-goals.html">2019 goals</a>—<em>be curious</em>. Instead of having expectations about how a situation should go, I want to be curious about how it actually is going. Often, there are lessons I need to learn which will come through observing and learning. Here’s to hoping I can let puppies sleep on hardwood floors more regularly.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have traditionally been big on setting goals, and have enjoyed thinking of plans for the new year. This year, I want to try something totally different.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-past">The past</h2>
<p>In the past, I have often set goals in each of the different areas of responsibility in my life. I have preferred to set goals that had a clear achievement moment, and have favored goals that were easier to put in my task manager. This provided a nice sense of accomplishment when I completed a goal and checked off the list, and I felt like they motivated me to be and do better.</p>
<p>2018 has been a year of significant personal discovery for me. One major thing that I have learned is that I am exceedingly hard on myself, and tend to view the world in black and white. Combined with my natural goal-setting, this has had the unforeseen consequence of setting myself up for repeated and measurable failure. It is very easy to get down on myself when I can review my goals and clearly see which ones I have not yet completed. And sadly, I have realized that this is much more common and instinctual for me than celebrating my successes.</p>
<h2 id="the-present">The present</h2>
<p>So for 2019, I instead want to focus on general principles that I want to incorporate more fully in my life. A key aspect of my plan is to intentionally embrace vague and fuzzy goals. I hope this will have a couple effects. One is to help me get more comfortable with ambiguity and living in the grey. Not everything can or needs to be clearly defined and articulated, and I need to sensitize myself to this reality. Another effect I hope for is to remove the possibility of marking these complete, or of identifying them as unfulfilled. With each goal, there will be a spectrum, and I hope to nudge myself in the direction of identifying what I have done, and looking at where I can still go.</p>
<p>Essentially, I am trying to let go of expectations and approach myself with curiosity.</p>
<h2 id="the-goals">The goals</h2>
<h3 id="1-be-intentional">1. Be intentional</h3>
<p>It is far too easy to allow life to happen to me, and I want to instead be more deliberate in my choices. Eventually, I want this to include deciding what I want to do on my phone before opening it, and then doing just that, and turning it off again. This could look like weekly and daily planning, although it might not. This might include task lists, but it also might not. This could look like deciding I am spend an evening playing <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, or it might not. This will hopefully mean sometimes setting everything of mine aside and just being present with my wife or with my kids.</p>
<h3 id="2-be-present">2. Be present</h3>
<p>When I feel overwhelmed, the natural reaction is to withdraw from the moment and numb, typically with something on my phone. This goal doesn’t mean that I will never be on my phone, but in keeping with my first goal, I want to decide that is want I am going to do, and then do it completely. I don’t expect to be perfect at this, especially at first, but I hope to explore ways in which to practice being present. One major area of focus is to be present with my own thoughts and feelings and not run away from them. I need to get to know myself better.</p>
<h3 id="3-be-curious">3. Be curious</h3>
<p>So much of dissatisfaction is due to a mismatch in expectations and reality. Often, I cannot control reality, but I can start to adjust my expectations. My hope is to develop the skill of letting go of expectations entirely, and just observing what happens. When built upon the first two goals, my hope is that this will allow me to be in any moment and situation and just be. Be authentic. Be genuine. Be me. And by doing this, I will come to know more and more of who I truly am—not who I have projected that I should be.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>
<p>I have such an amazing support structure in my life. My wife is kind and understanding and supportive, and I couldn’t ask for more in a partner. We will continue to improve our relationship and communication and tackle all of life’s challenges together. My children love me intensely; almost too much at times, bordering on hero worship. I need to remember that they love me as I am right now, and stop worrying about letting them down. We are blessed to live close to loving extended family, and I have a great job. Our church community is a great support and opportunity for selfless service. I am allowing myself to get the help that I need.</p>
<p>All in all, the future is bright. I look forward to a more relaxed and enjoyable year. Stress will come, but as I am intentional, present, and curious, I will respond as best I can.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Training a young puppy and parenting children require the same base set of skills. Getting better at one means that you are immediately better at the other.</p>
<hr>
<p>We first got a dog after child number three was born. Our oldest was about five, and it seemed like a good time to try this thing out. We went to our local humane society, and fell in love with Popcorn, a poodle-mini mix.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>He seemed good with kids because he didn’t bite them as they pulled at him, and we thought we had a winner. We tried to learn a bit about having a dog, but never did any formal training. Owning a dog was a lifelong dream of mine, and I was thrilled. However, we quickly found out that he was a yippy dog, and we had a hard time taking him out around other people or dogs. We realized that what he really wanted was to live with someone who would sit in a comfy armchair and cuddle him for most of the day. So in the end, we ended up selling him to a grandma.</p>
<p>Fast forward eight years and three more children, and we started thinking of getting a dog again. Our oldest is a serious animal lover, and we thought that having something for which she could be responsible would be good for her as well as the fulfillment of a Christmas wish. My wife has a friend who had a litter of puppies and we decided to buy one. He is a mix between an Australian Shepherd and a Border Collie.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While it is a little overwhelming to become puppy owners, we wanted to take it seriously and learn all we could about training. From a few friends who are big into dogs, we were recommended to watch training videos from <a href="https://www.dogtrainingrevolution.com">Zak George</a> and I have really enjoyed them. The more I watched, the more I realized that this is the same philosophy that we have tried to follow in parenting our six children. The basic premise is to reward positive behavior and redirect undesired behavior. As Zak stresses in his videos, the biggest mistake that new puppy parents make is to lose patience and become frustrated. This has definitely been true with our children as well.</p>
<p>I found myself wishing that I would have invested more time into training our first dog in order to learn and master these skills. I started to regret all the moments I have lost patience with my children and thought that if I had worked harder, I wouldn’t have had those moments. This is a vicious thought cycle that leads only to self-loathing and self-recrimination. I realized that I have been trying to develop and practice exactly those skills as I have worked to become a better dad. It hit me that part of the reason I am prepared to dive into puppy training is precisely because I have been working on the skills needed. So there is nothing to regret.</p>
<p>The final piece that is hard for me is how much easier it is to be patient and forgiving with a puppy than a child. I have thought a lot about this, because it has been hurtful to my children at times when I lose patience with them and then treat the puppy with kindness and forgiveness. I think that it all comes down to expectations. I expect that the puppy is going to have behaviors that I dislike, and I am prepared to deal with them. As much as I say to myself that I expect my children to also have undesired behaviors, I still find myself disappointed when they do not immediately follow instructions or when they act out. It has been helpful for me, particularly with the thirteen-year-old, to remind myself in the moment, “She is a puppy too.”</p>
<p>In the end, the key for me is an increase in compassion. I need to practice compassion for the puppy who is learning and adapting to a new life and trying to understand the training we do with him. I need to practice compassion for the children who are trying to figure themselves out and how to live and learn in this crazy world. And I need to practice compassion for myself. I am trying my best, just like the puppy.</p>

<p>If you find yourself having to regularly indulge in consumer self-care, it’s because you are disconnected from actual self-care, which has very little to do with “treating yourself” and a whole lot do with parenting yourself and making choices for your long-term wellness.</p>

			 <p><em>Lessons in motivation from a six-year-old</em></p>
<p>I had an interesting experience with my son last night that reminded me of an important lesson.</p>
<h2 id="the-context">The context</h2>
<p>In our church, <a href="https://lds.org">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</a>, we have no paid ministry but accept voluntary assignments to serve. As part of that, we all take turns cleaning our church building on a regular basis. Last night was our family’s turn.</p>
<h2 id="the-story">The story</h2>
<p>I took our oldest four kids to help me clean, while my wife put the younger two to bed. My six-year-old wanted to come help me vacuum the chapel room, but quickly announced how bored he was. I assigned him the job of moving the cord so that I didn’t trip on it and it didn’t get stuck. He continued to complain about the lameness of his task. Surprisingly, my sage advice about how service is not always what we want to do was not particularly helpful in changing his attitude. He announced, “I wanna vacuum!” I tried tell him that he needed to be taller to work the vacuum properly, but with no effect.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to take a different tack. I realized that we were halfway done, and it had been about ten minutes. “Last time I had this job,” I told him, “I vacuumed by myself and it took a full hour. This time, because of your help, we are going way faster. We make a great team!” It was like a switch had been flipped. He jumped up and ran forward to grab the cord and make sure I had some slack.</p>
<p>We continued through the rest of the room like that, with him jumping at each opportunity to smooth the way. As we neared completion, he asked again, “Dad, could I try to vacuum?” I realized that he mattered more than a perfect vacuuming job.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="the-lesson">The lesson</h2>
<p>As we drove home, I thought about what I had seen. There was a moment when the task transformed for my son, and it was a moment that I recognized happening in my own life. As soon as he understood how his contribution made a meaningful difference, his boredom changed to excitement. His perspective changed so that instead of being given a menial task with no consequence, he was helping to dramatically increase our capacity to serve.</p>
<p>So often, whether at work or in other areas of life, we can feel that we are plodding along, marking time. We see a role that seems to be more exciting or more prominent, and also cry out, “I wanna vacuum!” As a leader at work, part of my most important job is to help my team see how their contribution makes a meaningful difference. As an individual contributor, we all have the responsibility to seek out that meaning, or sometimes even to create it. Rarely are we truly stuck doing something that doesn’t matter at all. But often we lament that this is the case, instead of searching for meaning and purpose ourselves.</p>
<p>My hope is that I, and we all, can remember this vacuuming lesson from a six-year-old. Our perspective makes all the difference.</p>

			 <p>As I return back to work after a nice vacation with family, I have to face questions about motivation and whether I am doing what I really love.</p>
<p>I submitted two personal apps over the break, and was reminded how much I love building and creating and delivering. At work, I am now a manager, and have the opportunity to help drive our mobile strategy, but it also means that I get to code and ship much less. I am finding this to be a drain on my soul. This doesn’t necessarily mean that I need to quit or change jobs or anything that drastic. But I need to make sure that I am managing my time effectively so that I can continue to do what I love, even in the context of what I need to do. There are (almost) always opportunities for carving out space to do what feeds your soul amidst the daily pressures of commitments you have made. I am not sure where I see myself a few years from now, but I know that I need to be intentional about it. Here’s to a productive December!</p>

			 <p>Last week I had the opportunity to present at our local Cocoaheads meetup. At work, I have been focused on testing more as of late, and have been working to get our UI tests in much better shape.</p>
<p>I adapted an approach that our Test Engineering department has been taking with automated tests for our web apps. Essentially, we create a page object to represent each screen in the app, and include all of the elements, actions, and verifications needed for that screen. Then the actual UI tests just reference the page objects using the exposed API of actions and verifications. As an example, this has changed a call from this:</p>
<p><code>XCUIApplication().tables.children(matching: .cell).element(boundBy: 0).staticTexts[&quot;2018-07-03 20:45:14 +0000&quot;].tap()</code></p>
<p>to this:</p>
<p><code>.tapOnCell(at: 0)</code>.</p>
<p>I have really enjoyed the productivity boost this has given us, along with the safety and security of good test coverage and wanted to share this approach with the community. Included below is a PDF of my presentation.</p>

			 <p>I am lucky enough at work to be able to choose a conference every year to attend for professional development. This year, the five of us iOS developers decided we wanted to find a conference that would give us a slightly different perspective than we usually get, and one that we could all attend together. After hearing <a href="https://peersconf.com">Peers</a> mentioned both on <a href="https://coreint.org">Core Intuition</a> and <a href="https://releasenotes.tv">Release Notes</a>, a couple of the only tech podcasts to survive my latest purge, I proposed that we all head to Austin.</p>
<p>To be honest, we did not expect the content to be completely relevant for us. We recognized that Peers is primarily a web and business conference, and we all work as iOS developers at a large enterprise company. But since we are all involved with our company’s efforts to expand our business and start new ventures, we want to keep in touch with the startup and independent developer culture and try to embody some of that inside of our company.</p>
<p>We were pleasantly surprised to find that nearly all of the content was exceptionally helpful and relevant for us. From the beginning of the conference, we knew that it was going to be a different experience. <a href="https://twitter.com/justjessdc">Jess D’Amico</a> greeted us as we came in, and exclaimed, “Are you the group from O.C. Tanner?” We found a very warm welcome in this community and enjoyed ourselves tremendously.</p>
<p>The conference was extremely impactful to me on a personal level. On the first day, we participated in the business workshop, which consisted mainly of introductions and breakout sessions. The conversation of which I was part focused on discovering what is next in our careers. It was deeply personal and refreshingly open and honest. As we talked, someone asked if this was my first Peers. When I confirmed, he told me that this kind of conversation is the essence of Peers, and if I want to, I will find many more similar discussions throughout my time at the conference.</p>
<p>As I flew home, I took some time to write in my journal, and finally came to understand some of the things that I heard on that first day. A career is made up of so many moving pieces, and it can be a real challenge to line them all up properly. I still have a lot to think through and process as a result of Peers, but I am so grateful for the emotions and thoughts it stirred up. This is a kind and generous community that pushed and provoked me to think outside of my previous mental ruts, and I look forward to learning from and participating in it in the years to come.</p>

			 <p>My blog at bsn.io has been a great experience. I set it up a few years ago to be a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> blog and hosted it on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. I loved the flexibility this gave me, along with the performance of a static site. Over time, I figured out how to run it almost all from my iOS devices.</p>
<p>One of the downsides of this setup was the temptation to tinker. Because it was all in my control, I spent many hours tweaking things to get it just how I want on that particular day. Being a bit of a designer and developer, I have the curse of perma-tweaking that I have to resist. I finally decided that my time and energy were better directed elsewhere.</p>
<p>I have instead gone all in on <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>. I have long posted my content there, and have published microposts on my blog. <a href="https://manton.org">Manton Reece</a> has done a phenomenal job at building up the community and infrastructure of <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> so that it is both a blog hosting platform as well as a social network, and I am now going to use both.</p>
<p><strong>My new sites:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bsn.design">bsn.design</a>: my home for blogging and microblogging</li>
<li><a href="http://sketchnotable.com">sketchnotable.com</a>: dedicated to business-related sketchnotes</li>
<li><a href="http://mormonsketcher.com">mormonsketcher.com</a>: dedicated to religious sketchnotes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Micro.blog handles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.blog/bsndesign">@bsndesign</a>: my main social network account</li>
<li><a href="https://micro.blog/sketchnotable">@sketchnotable</a>: a feed solely for business-related sketchnotes</li>
<li><a href="https://micro.blog/mormonsketcher">@mormonsketcher</a>: a feed solely for religious sketchnotes</li>
</ul>
<p>My content will be cross-posted to Twitter with matching usernames, so if people prefer to find or engage with content there, I will continue to have a presence. But moving forward, I will be posting everything to one of my own sites first. Each of my sites has a JSON/RSS feed where you can subscribe if you want. Hopefully this makes it easy for people to choose the content that interests them most and follow or engage it with it easily.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://help.micro.blog/2015/why-i-created-this/">vision of Micro.blog</a> resonates strongly with me, and I am excited to fully participate in that community. Here’s to many more great years of sharing knowledge and creating meaningful interactions!</p>

			 <p>Part of being a <a href="mormon.org">Mormon</a> is regularly speaking or teaching in church. The official <a href="https://www.lds.org/pages/mobileapps/gospellibrary?lang=eng">Gospel Library app</a> makes it really simple to find resources to use in those talks and lessons. I like to have all of my content in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a>, which makes creating and referencing the content easy. But getting the quotes into markdown is not always easy. This morning, I created a few <a href="https://workflow.is">Workflow</a> recipes to simplify the process.</p>
<h2 id="converting-links">Converting links</h2>
<p>The first workflow allows you to select any text in the Gospel Library app and extracts the web link and converts it. The link start as something like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[www.lds.org/scripture...](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng)
</code></pre><p>The workflow converts the link from a web link to a link that will open the Gospel Library app directly to the content. The converted link looks like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>gospellibrary://content/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng
</code></pre><p><a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/convert-link-for-gospel-library.wflow">Download convert link workflow</a></p>
<h2 id="create-markdown-link">Create markdown link</h2>
<p>The second workflow builds on the first in some important ways. One of the most important pieces is grabbing the title and creating a formatted markdown link.</p>
<p>The other important piece is grabbing the verses and inserting them in the link if needed. As you might notice above, a link from Gospel Library will be to the chapter of scripture, but not the verses. One note here: if you are grabbing a link to content that does not have chapter and verses, the link will not be changed.</p>
<p>The markdown link looks like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-19](gospellibrary://content/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.18-19?lang=eng)
</code></pre><p><a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/markdown-link-from-gospel-library.wflow">Download markdown link workflow</a></p>
<h2 id="extracting-the-entire-quote">Extracting the entire quote</h2>
<p>The final piece is getting out the actual text of the quote. This last workflow uses the previous two in order to capture a formatted markdown quote. The output looks like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt; 18 Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.
&gt;
&gt; 19 And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.
&gt;
&gt; [Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-19](gospellibrary://content/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.18-19?lang=eng)
</code></pre><p><a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/markdown-quote-from-gospel-library.wflow">Download markdown quote workflow</a></p>
<p>All three workflows have to be downloaded and installed in order to get the final quote. When they are, it is just one touch to take selected text and get a nicely formatted quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>18 Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</p>
<p>19 And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</p>
<p><a href="gospellibrary://content/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.18-19?lang=eng">Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-19</a></p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>I have been asked frequently how to get started making iPhone apps. Having taught at an iOS development bootcamp for the past few years, I have seen many people approach iOS development and succeed well. Those that excel typically have the right <em>attitude</em> as well as the <em>aptitude</em>.</p>
<p>Part of the challenge is figuring out whether you have those two qualities, and to do so in the most cost- and time-efficient way possible. I almost always suggest the same three steps to people considering this, and thought it would be nice to write them down.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>
<ol>
<li>Learn the basics
<ul>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swift-playgrounds/id908519492?mt=8&amp;at=1010lqCX">Programming basics</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/GuidedTour.html">Swift basics</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html">Sample project</a></li>
<li>Build an app</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-exploring-the-basics">1. Exploring the basics</h2>
<p>The first step depends on your familiarity with programming in general. Many people have heard of this “coding” thing, and want to get in on it, but all they know is that apps are cool. That is a great place to start, but it is very different from a developer who is looking to learn iOS development in addition to their other skills.</p>
<h3 id="learning-programming-concepts">Learning programming concepts</h3>
<p>For those with no programming experience, I suggest some free exercises to learn some of the fundamentals. One of the best sources for those is an iPad app created by Apple: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swift-playgrounds/id908519492?mt=8&amp;at=1010lqCX">Swift Playgrounds app</a>. This will walk you through a number of puzzles and challenges to teach you the basics. This has the added bonus of teaching them using the Swift programming language, which is what you will be using to actually code apps.</p>
<p>This is a great chance to evaluate whether your <em>attitude</em> is the right fit. With the basic concepts, you are not going to know for a little while whether you have the best <em>aptitude</em>, but you can get a feel for whether you enjoy programming in general. As you learn, you will find that programming is often frustrating for long periods of time, followed by a rush as you solve the problem. You need to discover as quickly as possible whether that is a process that you enjoy.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-the-swift-language">Understanding the Swift language</h3>
<p>For developers looking to pick up iOS development, the Swift playgrounds app could still be helpful, but may feel overly basic and simplistic. Instead, Apple has created the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/GuidedTour.html">Swift language tour</a> that will help bring you up to speed on how to use Swift. The tour has additional links to more details about Swift to help those who prefer to go deep in learning the language.</p>
<h2 id="2-building-a-sample-project">2. Building a sample project</h2>
<p>Once you have a solid handle on the basics of programming and Swift, the next step is to build something. Again, Apple has created a great <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html">sample project</a> to walk you through all of the details required. This is a great resource because you can start with the end in mind, and have help all along the way to make that vision a reality.</p>
<p>By the time you have actually created an app, even though it is a simple guided project, you will have a much better idea of your <em>attitude</em> and <em>aptitude</em> fit. If the experience is starting to feel addictive, and you are anxious to create something that you want to have, that is a good sign. If you have been forcing yourself to push on just to finish what you started, you need to evaluate whether you want to continue to invest hundreds of hours in learning and continuing with iOS development. If you are learning programming for the first time, it is natural to need to reference documentation and other resources as you build your first project. Just because the solution does not come immediately to you does not mean that you lack the necessary <em>aptitude</em>. But if you finish the project, and still struggle understanding some of the basic principles, you need to do some honest introspection and decide if this is right for you.</p>
<h2 id="3-creating-your-first-app">3. Creating your first app</h2>
<p>The most important step is to try to create something that solves a problem that matters to you. This will stretch your ability to apply what you have learned. Up to this point, you have been focused on the “what” and “how” of iOS development. You need to advance to understanding the “when” and “why” of the different principles you have learned. When you tackle your own project, you have to determine at each step what you are trying to do, and evaluate the many options you have to solve the issue and choose the best fit and then implement it.</p>
<p>As you start to branch out beyond guided practice, you are going to need to rely on many resources. Obviously, searching the internet for what you are trying to do is going to be the first choice for many people. The risk in doing that is getting incomplete or incorrect information. When searching for resources, I suggest prioritizing the following resources above all others.</p>
<h3 id="apple-developer-marketing-y-pages">Apple Developer marketing-y pages</h3>
<p>Apple has done a lot of work in creating a starting point to help developers approach different topics. Whenever possible, you want to start with a marketing-type page from the Apple developer site. A great example is the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/">Apple iOS Developer page</a> for getting started in general. Most of these pages are included in the Resources list of the main <a href="https://developer.apple.com/develop/">Develop page</a> of the Apple Developer site. These pages are extremely helpful because they include an overview of the topic, along with curated lists of resources to dive deeper.</p>
<h3 id="programming-guides">Programming Guides</h3>
<p>If there is not a developer landing page, or if you are ready to go deeper on a topic, you should look for a programming guide. These include detailed explanations along with sample code to help you understand a topic thoroughly. They can range from broad topics such as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html">App Programming Guide for iOS</a> to more specifics such as the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/">View Controller Programming Guide</a>.</p>
<h3 id="source-code-documentation">Source code documentation</h3>
<p>Finally, you should look to the actual documentation Apple creates for the APIs you want to use. These can be found either online, or through Xcode. An example is the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller">UIViewController documentation</a>. As you become more advanced, you will find yourself referencing this kind of documentation more and more without needing the additional explanations that come in the developer pages or programming guides. The existence of these pages is one of the main reasons that I prefer iOS development to web development. If you ever have a question about how something works, or what is possible, you can go look at the source documentation. This becomes your “Bible” and is always available for reference.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here</h2>
<p>When you have made it this far, you have a decision to make. If you want iOS development to be a hobby or something you do on the side because it is fun, you can just keep trying to build more projects. If you become more serious about improving your skills and abilities, you will want to look for more advanced resources.</p>
<p>Apple has produced a series of books designed for education that can also be used for those looking to teaching themselves. Start with <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/intro-to-app-development-with-swift/id1118575552?mt=11&amp;at=1010lqCX">Intro to App Development with Swift</a> is that is what you want.</p>
<p>Another resource to consider is getting further education, such as a coding bootcamp or a college degree. Obtaining a degree in higher education is a great way to master the theory behind programming and can be a great stepping stone to future opportunities. A coding bootcamp is a much faster path to determine your <em>attitude</em> and <em>aptitude</em> fit, and to be able to start shipping apps. Often, this level of education is sufficient to start contributing as a junior developer, and you will learn even more of what is needed to succeed on the job. However, many people that finish a coding bootcamp still need to continue to invest serious time in creating apps and gaining experience before they are ready to be employed.</p>
<p>Hopefully this has been useful if you are considering getting started with iOS development. It is a magical opportunity of pure creation. I hope you will join me on this exciting journey.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Apple generally provides us as developers plenty of notice to make updates, whether explicit or implied. There are a number of these that I have been doing slowly this year for various reasons—High Sierra, Swift 4, iPhone X layout. Starting at WWDC, we could have been updating our apps to be prepared for the iPhone X layout changes, although none of us knew exactly what to expect. All we knew was that “safe area layout guides” were a thing and we should be using them.</p>
<p>Since receiving my own iPhone X, I have been much more motivated to get my own apps updated to work better with the unique layout challenges. I wanted to capture some of the standard changes I find myself making repeatedly.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> I make heavy use of storyboards, so most of my explanations will involve Interface Builder.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#enable-safe-area-layout-guides">Enable safe area layout guides</a></li>
<li><a href="#table-views">Table views</a></li>
<li><a href="#custom-separators">Custom separators</a></li>
<li><a href="#extra-bottom-view">Extra bottom view</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="enable-safe-area-layout-guides">Enable safe area layout guides</h2>
<p>The first crucial step is to enable safe area layout guides in the storyboard. When updating from Xcode 8 to Xcode 9, this setting will be off by default, while any new storyboards created in Xcode 9 will have it enabled by default. Simply open the file inspector (the first inspector in the right pane in Xcode), and check the box named “Use Safe Area Layout Guides” to enable them.</p>
<p><a href="http://bsn.micro.blog/uploads/2018/127789d40c.jpg"><a href="http://bsn.micro.blog/uploads/2018/127789d40c.jpg"

       alt="Enable safe area layout guides" 
       
          title="Enable safe area layout guides"
        
  />
</a>

</a></p>
<h2 id="table-views">Table views</h2>
<p>Through the content view in <code>UITableViewCell</code>, table views work almost magically with the iPhone X. One of the main changes I have found is that the table view itself needs to be constrained to the actual view of the view controller, and not the safe area. If you had the table view constrained to the edges in Xcode 8, when you enable the safe area layout guides, those constraints will be converted to be relative to the safe area. For a table view, you don’t want that. You need to go in and modify each constraint to be relative to the superview instead.</p>
<p><a href="http://bsn.micro.blog/uploads/2018/c83112768a.jpg"><a href="http://bsn.micro.blog/uploads/2018/c83112768a.jpg"

       alt="Constrain to superview" 
       
          title="Constrain to superview"
        
  />
</a>

</a></p>
<h2 id="custom-separators">Custom separators</h2>
<p>Many of my custom table view cells will have a custom separator line. This is common if different cells in the same table need to have different separators. Typically, those views were constrained to the content view of the cell. However, that will leave the separators inset when in landscape mode because of the safe area layout guides. Instead, constrain the views to the cell itself. The exception to this rule is for separators that should be inset, typically on the leading edge. In that case, the leading edge of the view should remain constrained to the content view of the cell in order to retain the proper inset.</p>
<p><a href="http://bsn.micro.blog/uploads/2018/6202d08f22.jpg"><a href="http://bsn.micro.blog/uploads/2018/6202d08f22.jpg"

          title="Constrain to cell"
        
  />
</a>

</a></p>
<h2 id="extra-bottom-view">Extra bottom view</h2>
<p>Many designs have a view at the bottom of the screen. This view would typically be constrained to the bottom layout guide previously, and that constraint would be converted to be relative to the safe area. This will leave an unsightly gap at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p><a href="http://bsn.micro.blog/uploads/2018/554ae838c9.jpg"><a href="http://bsn.micro.blog/uploads/2018/554ae838c9.jpg"

       alt="Gap at bottom" 
       
          title="Gap at bottom"
        
  />
</a>

</a>
<em>Bottom view constrained to safe area</em></p>
<p>There are two solutions I have used to correct this situation. The first is to simply add an extra <code>UIView</code> with a matching background color below the original view. That view will be constrained to the leading and trailing of the original view, and the bottom will be constrained to the superview—not the safe area. Then with a vertical spacing constraint between the views, you are set. When on a device where the safe area is the bottom of the device, the extra view will have a height of 0. On the iPhone X, the extra view will go from the bottom of the screen up to the bottom of the safe area.</p>
<p>The other solution is very similar, but instead of placing the view below your original view, it is embedded inside of it with a clear background color. Then you change the constraints of the original view to be to the superview and not the safe area. Then any views you have inside of your original view will have their bottom relative to this new spacer view. This is definitely the preferred solution if your original view is a visual effect view.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>There are many more adjustments to consider when updating an app for the iPhone X, but these are the most common situations I have encountered. I look forward to having my apps feel at home on this new device.</p>

			 <p>I have <a href="/2017/01/06/using-workflow-to.html">written</a> <a href="/2017/01/12/public-drafts-with.html">before</a> about my attempts to publish to my GitHub Pages blog from iOS. I have recently started using <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com/">Working Copy</a> to make this even easier. Basically, I am trying to remove all of my excuses in the hopes that I will be more diligent in posting to my blog.</p>
<p>There are three pieces to my new process that I want to explore:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#microblog-posts">Microblog posts</a></li>
<li><a href="#new-drafts">New drafts</a></li>
<li><a href="#publishing">Publishing</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="microblog-posts">Microblog posts</h2>
<p>Since September 2016, I have been publishing <a href="/microblog">microblog</a> posts to my own site in addition to sharing them on <a href="https://twitter.com/bsndesign">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://instagram.com/sketchnotable">Instagram</a>, and more recently on <a href="https://micro.blog/bsn">Micro.blog</a>. This has come as a direct result of listening to <a href="http://manton.org">Manton Reece</a> and agreeing with his thoughts on <a href="http://www.manton.org/2017/02/owning-your-content-matters-right-now.html">owning your content</a>. I want to continue the simplicity of being able to post a thought quickly, particularly with an image since I am often sharing my <a href="/tags/sketchnotes">sketchnotes</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to using Working Copy, my process involved <a href="https://workflow.is">Workflow</a> recipes that made use of the GitHub API to post the content to my site repository. Essentially, I still use the same process in terms of taking the text or images and publishing them to my site. But my <a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/microblog-post-in-working-copy.wflow">new Workflow recipe</a> is considerably simpler, and leverages Working Copy and <a href="http://x-callback-url.com/">X-Callback-URLs</a> to simplify the process.</p>
<h2 id="new-drafts">New drafts</h2>
<p>My favorite writing app, <a href="https://ia.net/writer/">iA Writer</a>, gives me great flexibility in writing my posts. I have gone back and forth on storing my drafts just in iA Writer using iCloud, or having them live in my site repository. Thanks to iA Writer’s feature of opening directly a file from another app, and Working Copy serving as a document provider, I can create a draft in Working Copy and edit it in iA Writer. As of now, my current process is to create a draft in iA Writer using <a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/new-draft-in-ia-writer.wflow">this Workflow</a>. When I feel like it is ready, I will publish it as a draft to my site using <a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/publish-draft-in-working-copy.wflow">this Workflow</a>. That gives me the chance to see it in context on my site, together with all images and links and make sure that everything looks good and works properly.</p>
<h2 id="publishing">Publishing</h2>
<p>The final step is taking my post from draft status to published. As I mentioned, at this point the post is live on my site in the Drafts section, so I can proofread and check everything. I do my editing either in Working Copy or iA Writer, committing the changes back to GitHub. When I am finally ready to pull the trigger, <a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/publish-post-in-working-copy.wflow">this Workflow</a> essentially moves the file from the Drafts folder to the Posts folder, and edits the file name a bit to make it an official post on my blog. The Workflow takes me to my site at the end so I can see the post one last time in all its published glory.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Using Working Copy on my iPad / iPhone means that I always have the entire source code of my site with me. It has made life so much easier when I want to edit or tweak the site. Since I prefer to write in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, and to do everything on an iOS device, this has been the ideal setup for me. Simple integrations with Workflow keep process frictionless. Hopefully this is enough to help ensure that I post more often to my blog.</p>
<p>Just for reference, here are all of the Workflow recipes I am currently using for this process:</p>

			 <p>Taking the day off with six kids running around is so different than you expect a sick day to go. You start thinking, “Maybe I should just go into work.” Of course, it’s nothing compared to trying to take a sick day as a mom…</p>

			 <p>I think that all humans are phasic to some degree or other. As a strange mix of emotion and logic, there are natural tensions that operate on us. We are wired to notice the new or unusual, and this has a real impact on our ability to focus on a task or project for an extended length of time. I have found that to be extremely true in myself. I will get excited about a new project and dive in with great passion. But after the novelty wears off, and I am distracted by something new, it is far too easy to let go of previous projects.</p>
<p>This has certainly been true with my blogging. I will go in phases where I am diligent about writing, and find it extremely beneficial. But, inevitably, new things come up. For me, those typically come in the form of new apps that I want to build. It is a real challenge to maintain consistency with a naturally long-term task like blogging.</p>
<p>At different times in my life, I have tried to fight this tendency with varying levels of success. There are certainly long-term commitments that need to not fade from priority or lose attention. Some of the most important for me are my wife and six kids. But not all projects needs to have that same level of persistence.</p>
<p>Lately, I have been thinking more about embracing the fact that my interests drift. Obviously there needs to be a balance so that crucial part of life are not abandoned. But it is really not a problem if I start on a project, and then move on to another one before finishing the first. Too often, I will stick with a project just because it was the plan, and not because it is still the priority. I want to get better at being flexible and adapting, and my personality pulls at me to do that already.</p>
<p>Moving forward, my philosophy will be to ride the wave a bit more. There is a natural ebb and flow to life, and it is ok to give myself permission to follow that. I need to occasionally take stock and make sure that my true priorities are not being neglected. But in my hobbies and side projects, I am allowing myself to dive in when I am passionate and back off when I am not. I will check back in after a few months and see what adjustments need to be made.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I wrote <a href="/2017/01/06/using-workflow-to.html">last week</a> about publishing to a GitHub Pages blog using <a href="https://workflow.is">Workflow</a> on the iPad. As I worked on writing that post, I realized there was one piece missing from my process: previewing the draft. When I write locally on my computer, I compile the site using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/">Jekyll commands</a> and include drafts. Then I can work on a post and make sure that the links all work properly and do a final check before publishing the post. With the Workflow process I created, a post would go straight from iA Writer to being published on my site, and that made me a bit nervous.</p>
<h2 id="displaying-drafts">Displaying drafts</h2>
<p>Jekyll <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/">already supports drafts</a>, but the only way to see them is when building locally. As I looked into the easiest way to display drafts on my published site, I realized that I already have a model that would work well. For my <a href="/apps">apps</a> and <a href="/libraries">libraries</a>, I am using the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/">collections feature</a> of Jekyll. In order to extend the default functionality of drafts to make them public, only a few small changes are needed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add drafts collection</li>
<li>Specify default layout</li>
<li>Make an index page</li>
<li>Prevent indexing</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-add-drafts-collection">1. Add drafts collection</h3>
<p>In your <code>_config.yml</code> file, add a few lines to enable the drafts collection:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="2-specify-default-layout">2. Specify default layout</h3>
<p>Also in <code>_config.yml</code>, it is easiest to provide a default layout for all drafts. This way, you can omit the layout from the front matter of the actual post, and it will display correctly when it is a draft, as well as when you publish the post.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="3-make-an-index-page">3. Make an index page</h3>
<p>At this point, the individual drafts will display correctly, but it is much easier to have a list page to access them. It can be as simple as this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="4-prevent-indexing">4. Prevent indexing</h3>
<p>You may have noticed an entry in the front matter of the drafts index page with the key <code>meta_robots</code>. I have something similar in the <code>draft.html</code> default layout:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>These insert the correct metadata in the <code>head</code> using the following code:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This ensures that the drafts can be posted without impacting the site or having incorrect links show up in search results. It is still possible for someone to find one of these posts and link to it, which will result in a 404 after publishing, but the likelihood of that is low enough to not be a real concern.</p>
<h2 id="add-workflows">Add workflows</h2>
<p>All of this work is nice, but without some additions and updates to the workflows I <a href="/2017/01/06/using-workflow-to.html">posted previously</a>, this would still require publishing from a computer. As I looked into support for publishing drafts using Workflow, the one piece missing was the ability to send a <code>DELETE</code> message to the GitHub API. I asked Workflow support if there was any way to do this and got a fantastic response with a workaround.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Armed with this workaround, I was able to create a few additional workflows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/publish-draft-to-github.wflow">Publish draft</a></li>
<li><a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/update-draft-on-github.wflow">Update draft</a></li>
<li><a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/delete-files-on-github.wflow">Delete files</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="improved-post-publishing">Improved post publishing</h3>
<p>Finally, I wanted to handle the draft well when publishing the blog post. The workflow to publish a post will hit GitHub first to see if a draft is there with the same name, and if so, the draft will be deleted and the post will be published with the correct date. This completes the draft process, allowing you to start by publishing a draft, update it one or more times for review, and then actually publishing the post.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/publish-blog-post-to-github.wflow">Publish post</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="previous-workflows">Previous workflows</h2>
<p>Just for reference, here are the previous workflows that have all been updated:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/update-blog-post-on-github.wflow">Update post</a></li>

			 <p><em>Update: I published <a href="/2018/05/01/public-drafts-with.html">a follow-up post</a> about incorporating drafts into the process.</em></p>
<h2 id="microblog-posts">Microblog posts</h2>
<p>This blog is hosted using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, which has worked out extremely well for me. However, there can sometimes be too much friction to get content published, especially short-form microblog posts. Recently, I was talking with <a href="http://manton.org/">Manton Reece</a> about how to publish Instagram posts to my microblog. He mentioned that he uses <a href="https://workflow.is/">Workflow</a>, a fantastic automation app for iOS, to take an Instagram photo and publish it to his WordPress blog. He wrote <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/blogging-your-photos.html">a post</a> about his process that was helpful as I looked at how to make this work for my needs. Another big help was a recent series about Workflow on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/canvas">Canvas</a>, a podcast about iPhone and iPad productivity.</p>
<p>I only recently started posting my professional content to Instagram, such as sketchnotes and drawings, and it feels like a great fit. I want to keep sharing there, but I want to make sure that I have my own record of the content I am posting as well. Using <a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/microblog-post-to-github.wflow">the workflow I created</a>, here are the basic steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>While posting to Instagram, copy the caption text to the clipboard. This will be the default text for the microblog post, although I can edit it if I want.</li>
<li>Select the image in Photos, or run the workflow and select the image later.</li>
<li>Workflow creates a title for both the image and the post based on the date.</li>
<li>Confirm the post text that Workflow creates, complete with the proper front matter for posting to GitHub.</li>
<li>Workflow commits the image and, if that is successful, the text post to my blog repository using the GitHub API.</li>
<li>Optionally compose a tweet with the image and text of the post.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am pretty excited about how simple it is. I have made the workflow so that it can be launched from some text, an image, or even directly in Workflow and select the image and write the text later. This has helped reduce the friction and encourages me to post more frequently. You can still <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sketchnotable/">follow me on Instagram</a>, but all of my posts will also be available on my <a href="/microblog/">microblog</a>.</p>
<h2 id="full-blog-posts">Full blog posts</h2>
<p>After getting publishing working for microblog posts, I had to keep going. I have started most of my posts on the iPad using <a href="https://ia.net/writer/">iA Writer</a>, and up until now, I would sync them over to my computer to publish them to GitHub. I decided to make a few more workflows so that I could do all of my publishing from my iPad, or even my iPhone. They all work similarly to the workflow for microblog posts. Here are links to download the workflows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/publish-blog-post-to-github.wflow">Publish Blog Post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/publish-photos-to-github.wflow">Publish Photos</a></li>
<li><a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/update-blog-post-on-github.wflow">Update Blog Post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/publish-files-to-github.wflow">Publish Files</a></li>
<li><a href="https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/update-files-on-github.wflow">Update Files</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The update workflows will take in an existing file, find it on GitHub, and commit an update to the file. Adding the workflows for photos and files allows me to publish everything that the blog post will need. These have the side benefit of being able to upload any files to a repository, so their use is not limited to GitHub Pages blogs.</p>
<h2 id="going-meta">Going meta</h2>
<p>One of my favorite parts of writing this post describing my new process is using that process. I even added a step to publish and update drafts on my site so that I can preview them and make sure all of the links are working properly before publishing. So I have written this post in iA Writer, published a draft and a few updates to my blog using Workflow, and am now publishing and sharing the actual post using Workflow. 💥</p>
<h2 id="onward">Onward</h2>
<p>Part of my reason for posting this is to motivate my future self to be more consistent with posting. I have removed all of my excuses, and look forward to writing more regularly. Hopefully this has been helpful to you as well. If you have any thoughts or questions, feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/bsndesign">reach out on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p><em>Old Union Station in Indianapolis</em></p>
<p>This week, I attended <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/conference">Release Notes</a>, and it was great. I sketchnoted the talks, and <a href="/2016/09/29/release-notes-sketchnotes.html">posted a summary</a> with all of them. Before I came to the conference, my wife asked what I was hoping to get out of it, and my first answer was to meet new people. She was a little surprised by that, and reminded me that networking is not something that I typically enjoy or do particularly well. So I set a goal to talk with at least one person each day for an extended time and get to know them better.</p>
<p>Accomplishing that goal was easier than I had thought, although it still required me to push myself outside of my comfort zone. The conference was organized intentionally for a group of introverted developers who want to meet other people, but are not skilled at that. We had plenty of time between talks to have conversations, and long breaks for lunch and before dinner. It was perfect for me. The other big thing that helped was my sketchnotes. After the first couple talks, people began to notice the sketchnotes, and it was an easy jumping off point to begin conversations with people. It is so much easier when people come up to talk to you instead of the inverse.</p>
<h2 id="action-items">Action items</h2>
<p>I want to force myself to turn my thoughts into action as I leave the conference. I found myself talking about <a href="/apps/#pointedly">Pointedly</a> every time that I introduced myself, and realized that it is my true passion project right now, and I should do more with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Designate different locations and positions for different kinds of work</li>
<li>Have a lawyer review my LLC</li>
<li>Get liability insurance</li>
<li>Form a daily writing habit</li>
<li>Set writing goals for my blog and journal</li>
<li>Experiment with pricing in my apps</li>
<li>Prepare Pointedly for a subscription model</li>
<li>Answer all outstanding support requests</li>
<li>Schedule daily time for support</li>
<li>Answer incoming support within a day</li>
<li>Say exactly what I mean, without trying to make someone feel a certain way</li>
<li>Plan a solid demo for each app I want to show off and practice it</li>
<li>Find an official personal board of directors</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these actions items come down to discipline for me. I need to be better at time management and making sure that I am focusing on my most important tasks. My adherence to a planning and execution system has fluctuated wildly, but I know that I am most effective when I am consistent and methodical.</p>
<h2 id="sketchnotes">Sketchnotes</h2>
<p>One unexpected outcome of this conference was a rekindling of my passion for sketchnoting. I have done some occasional sketchnotes over the past couple of years, but since I started focusing on iOS development, I have done little else. One thing that I want to let simmer in the back of my mind is an app to help with sketchnoting. I have no idea what shape that will take yet, but it would be a perfect marriage of my two biggest professional passions. In the meantime, I want to make sure that this is a skill that I continue to hone and exercise regularly. Creating sketchnotes is incredibly rewarding personally, but the best part is the connections that it forms with others. People are drawn to them, and it makes for great conversations that could not happen otherwise. Like most things, I need to carve out time to practice so that I can progress and avoid regressing.</p>
<p>I am so grateful that I had the opportunity to attend Release Notes this year. I look forward to working to implement these ideas and to continue to learn from others and nurture the relationships that I formed.</p>

			 <p>One goal that I have had for all of my open-source projects is to have run automated builds and have complete test coverage. Achieving this goals is a slow process, but something that I have wanted to learn and get more comfortable with so that I can be more disciplined. I decide to post the build status and coverage data for all of my libraries on my site, to provide myself additional incentive to hurry and get everything updated.</p>
<p>At my day job, we are using <a href="https://jenkins.io">Jenkins</a> and <a href="https://fastlane.tools">Fastlane</a> to run all unit and UI tests after every commit that is pushed, and to submit to iTunes Connect after every merge to <code>master</code> following a successful pull request. For my open-source libraries, I just wanted something to make sure that they build and run all the tests after changes. For now, I landed on using <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis</a> to run the automated builds, and <a href="https://codecov.io">Codecov</a> to collect coverage reports. I wanted to capture some of the process to be able to refer back to it, and hopefully it can help others with similar goals.</p>
<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<p><em>All examples are using my <a href="https://github.com/benjaminsnorris/TextMagic">TextMagic</a> framework. Remember to change the names to match your project.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Set up <a href="https://travis-ci.org/profile">Travis</a> to start building your project</li>
<li>Add <code>travis.yml</code> to project (see sample below)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to build either project or workspace, as needed</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Add <code>slather.yml</code> to to limit coverate reporting to <code>Sources</code> using <a href="https://github.com/SlatherOrg/slather">Slather</a> (see sample below)</li>
<li>Include a call to <a href="https://codecov.io/">Codecov</a> after the build in Travis to collect code coverage information (see sample below)</li>
<li>Test locally to make sure that it builds properly and then view the reports on Codecov</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>xcodebuild -workspace TextMagic.xcworkspace -scheme TextMagic -sdk iphonesimulator9.3 -destination=&quot;OS=9.3,name=iPhone 6S Plus&quot; -configuration Debug GCC_INSTRUMENT_PROGRAM_FLOW_ARCS=YES GCC_GENERATE_TEST_COVERAGE_FILES=YES ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=YES test | xcpretty -c</code></li>

			 <p>This will not come as a surprise to most people—writing tests makes your code better. I have come to appreciate this more over the past few months, as I wrote about <a href="/2016/07/14/leveling-up-with.html">previously</a>. Also not a surprise—writing tests first makes your code even better. From my experience with iOS developers, while we might know this, most of us do not do it. Even after coming to see the value, it is easy to skip straight to writing the code. I had an experience this week that highlighted the value of this for me again, and wanted to pause and reflect before allowing myself to lose the lesson.</p>
<h2 id="the-story">The story</h2>
<p>I wrote earlier this week about <a href="/2016/08/31/handling-live-text.html">handling live text reload elegantly</a>, and wanted to share a bit more about the process I went though. It went something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>💡 Think of a great idea to add to the app</li>
<li>🖥 Write the code to update text and preserve cursor position</li>
<li>⌨️ Write tests to verify my code worked properly</li>
<li>🎊 Bask in the illusion of completion</li>
<li>🙄 Step away from the project and realize I should probably support text selection as well</li>
<li>⌨️ Write failing tests for all the scenarios I could think of</li>
<li>🖥 Implement the logic for text selection</li>
<li>😒 Run the tests and realize I had broken cursor position support</li>
<li>😅 Repeat previous two steps until everything passed</li>
<li>🎉 Write an exultant blog post</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-realization">The realization</h2>
<p>After I was done, it hit me how different it was to write the code before the tests instead of vice versa. When the code came first, my tests just verified my code. I had come up with all the scenarios I thought I needed to support, and had coded them, so I just made sure that they worked as I intended.</p>
<p>However, when I wrote the tests first, it was a completely different mental exercise. I was not worried about how I was going to implement the different scenarios—I was just focused on thinking of all possible scenarios. Not only did I think of many different cases for text selection, but I realized that I had omitted a number of cases for cursor position as well.</p>
<h2 id="the-takeaway">The takeaway</h2>
<p>My adherence to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> has ebbed and flowed over time. It is easy to want to jump straight into writing the code and seeing something work in the simulator. But taking the time at the beginning to consider the desired behavior, and writing tests for that behavior makes for better code and fewer rewrites and regressions.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it can feel impossible to start with tests. Your tests will not compile if the objects they are testing do not exist yet. One approach that has worked well for me is to start by writing descriptive function names for tests, and then moving on to writing the rest of everything. The process looks something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a test case class and write empty test functions</li>
<li>Create objects with properties and stubbed functions</li>
<li>Fill in failing tests to verify behavior</li>
<li>Implement the functions and logic needed for the tests to pass</li>
<li>Adjust tests and code as needed</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most exciting aspects to programming is how much you learn while you are working through something. Invariably, you will have to make changes to the tests as you think through the implementation details. The trick is to make sure that your tests remain focused on the behavior, and not the actual implementation details. That way, if you refactor the implementation, your tests can still verify that the behavior remains intact.</p>
<h2 id="the-conclusion">The conclusion</h2>
<p>A major benefit to using this approach is that it helps you write more reusable code, which has been a <a href="/2016/07/05/writing-reusable-code.html">focus of mine</a> lately. You still need to learn about good design patterns and best practices. But starting with your tests means that you are exercising the API from the beginning, and that will help you think through having a good API as you build it.</p>
<p>Part of my purpose in writing this post is to help myself recommit to TDD in all of my projects. It is too easy to get lazy and skip the tests altogether. That is part of why I have put build, coverage and version badges on all of my open-source project pages on this site. I am hoping that the shame of not having tests and builds and coverage will help motivate me to get this done quickly. My future self will thank me later.</p>

			 <p>In my current project at my day job, we are using <a href="https://firebase.google.com">Firebase</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift">ReSwift</a>. I plan to write more about this powerful combination soon. One of the major advantages is that it allows us to easily support live reloading of concurrent editing. However, I ran into a problem in long-form text editing. It was impressive to see the text update while someone else edited the same data, but if you were also trying to type, it would get extremely frustrating. With every reload, your cursor would jump to the end of the text, making it nearly impossible to keep working.</p>
<p>One of my favorite podcasts, <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/runtime">Runtime</a>, recently mentioned approaches to diffing text. I reached out to <a href="https://twitter.com/soffes">Sam Soffes</a>, who pointed me to a simple library he created for this, <a href="https://github.com/soffes/diff">diff</a>.</p>
<p>Using that library, I was ready to tackle preserving the cursor position and text selection when the underlying text changed. In the hopes that others can benefit from or improve this work, here is the code that I am using:</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Like many developers, I was anxious to install iOS 10 on my devices. This summer, I went all in and installed iOS 10 beta on my primary iPhone, iPad, as well as watchOS 3 beta on my Apple Watch. I have had remarkably few issues, but one of the major problems was installing apps that I still needed to work on that needed to be shipped before iOS 10 came out.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>By default, you cannot install an app from Xcode 7 on a device running iOS 10. You will see an error that reads, “Could not find Developer Disk Image” as shown below.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The problem is that Xcode 7 does not have support for iOS 10. Using Terminal, you can easily see which operating systems Xcode is able to support.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ cd /Applications/Xcode.app/Content/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport
$ ls
</code></pre><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>
<p>In order for Xcode 7 to install apps on your device running iOS 10, you first need to make sure that it works with Xcode 8. Download the beta, and open a project with your device connected. Typically, you will need to wait for the symbol files to install, and then you should be able to install. In some cases, restarting your device is necessary, or even resetting the network settings (<code>Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Reset -&gt; Reset Network Settings</code>).</p>
<p>Once that it working, you can look in the Xcode beta device support folder to find iOS 10 support.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are a couple options to give Xcode 7 the information that it needs. You could copy over the folder containing 10.0 support, but the simplest option is to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link">symbolic link</a> using the <code>ln</code> command in Terminal (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/ln.1.html">documentation</a>). As you type this out in Terminal, be sure to use <code>Tab</code> to help autocomplete the directory names in order to avoid typos. And naturally, if either Xcode app is in a different place, or the exact version of iOS 10 is different, you will make adjustments for your environment.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ ln -s
   /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/10.0\ \(14A5339a\)/
   /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/10.0
</code></pre><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After adding the link, you will need to quit and restart Xcode 7. Connect your iOS 10 device, and you should now be able to install and run your app!</p>

			 <p>Since deciding that I wanted to change careers to become a full-time developer, I have started listening to a number of podcasts. Some of my favorites are <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar">Under the Radar</a>, the spiritual successor to my previous favorite <a href="http://developingperspective.com">Developing Perspective</a>, <a href="http://www.coreint.org">Core Intuition</a>, and <a href="https://releasenotes.tv">Release Notes</a>. There are many others that I have enjoyed off and on, including the <a href="http://atp.fm">Accidental Tech Podcast</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk Show</a>, as well as some new ones I am loving, such as <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/runtime">Runtime</a> and <a href="https://www.relay.fm/canvas">Canvas</a>. I am not sure how many hours of podcasts I have listened to, but I know that <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a> has saved me an extra 46 hours from Smart Speed alone, if that tells you anything.</p>
<p>One of the interesting things about listening to podcasts is that you spend hours and hours listening to someone share their thoughts and feelings on issues that are important in your life. You start to feel as if you know these people from having spent so much time with them. And since most friendships come from spending time together, you begin to feel as if you are friends.</p>
<p>But there is a problem.</p>
<p>The person on the other end of this relationship does not know you at all. They have no idea that they have spent countless hours with you. From their perspective, there is <em>no</em> relationship.</p>
<p>I had an experience recently where I was on the other end of this phenomenon. In addition to my day job as an iOS developer, I work at <a href="https://devmounta.in">DevMountain</a>, a coding bootcamp here in Utah, teaching iOS development. Many of the lessons that I have given were recorded, and current students watch those recordings as part of their curriculum. Over the past few weeks, I have had a few students come up and talk to me. They both said something to the effect of, “I feel like I know you from watching all your videos.” I had to chuckle when I realized that I had an lopsided relationship with these students.</p>
<p>My mind was taken back to WWDC 2015, when I had the chance to meet _David Smith, the man behind Developing Perspective. We got to chat for just a minute, and I told him how much his podcast and his willingness to share what he has learned have helped me in my own development career. It was a highlight of the conference for me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>Caleb Hicks, David Smith, Joshua Howland, and me</em></p>
<p>From these difference experiences, and from talking with other people, I have some thoughts about how to handle meeting someone with whom you are in one of these lopsided relationships. If you are on the side that believes that you are friends, start with a brief statement explaining how you know the other person. That can go a long way to alleviate an otherwise awkward encounter. If you are on the oblivious side, do your best to make the other person feel comfortable. Recognize that the person who is meeting you feels vulnerable and probably a little intimidated. If you are both introverted developers, chances are neither of you are particularly good at interpersonal interactions, so you will both be awkward together, and that is ok.</p>
<p>However these relationships form, they can turn into real, meaningful relationships with just a little effort. Almost everyone who produces work that you admire is just a normal, friendly person and would appreciate you saying a kind word letting them know what you appreciate about them. Next time you see someone in a lopsided relationship with you, go up and introduce yourself!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.bennorris.com/2016/08/05/retrieving-ios-shared.html">Retrieving iOS shared web credentials</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://micro.bennorris.com/2016/08/05/retrieving-ios-shared.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2016-08-05 14:00:00 -0600">Aug 5, 2016</time></a>

			 <h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>One of the most annoying interactions with any app or service is logging in. None of us likes having to remember usernames and passwords, and often they are difficult to type in. Even if they are easy, it is never what you actually want to do. You are accessing an app or service in order to accomplish a task, and logging in is a barrier to success. However, none of us want to feel like our sensitive information is not secure, so logging in is something of a necessary evil.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>
<p>One thing that you can do as a developer is to make this experience as simple and painless as possible. One option, which I plan to discuss in the future, is to integrate with <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>. This is a popular password management app, and integration is quite simple.</p>
<p>Another approach is what I want to cover today: integrating with Shared Web Credentials, or from a user’s perspective, integrating with Safari saved passwords. This is available since iOS 8, and is an effective way to simplify life for your users. You should read the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Security/Reference/SharedWebCredentialsRef/">official documentation</a>, but I will go through the steps that I did in order to retrieve passwords successfully. In a future post, I will address creating an account and saving a new password.</p>
<h2 id="the-steps">The steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Add entitlement and configure app</li>
<li>Upload site association file to server</li>
<li>Add password to Safari on Simulator or device</li>
<li>Add code to retrieve password</li>
<li>Run app</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="entitlement">Entitlement</h3>
<p>Xcode does a great job of simplifying the process of adding entitlements. In order to use shared web credentials, you need to enable the <code>Associated Domains</code> entitlement:</p>
<p><a href="https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/97cfca51e9.png">Associated domains</a></p>
<p>Then in place of <code>example.com</code>, you need to put your domain. Read through the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Security/Reference/SharedWebCredentialsRef/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014989-CH1-DontLinkElementID_5">documentation</a> for this section to make sure that you do not miss anything.</p>
<h3 id="site-association-file">Site association file</h3>
<p>In order for the association to work, you have to upload a simple JSON file to your server. Even if you do not have a web app that users will sign in to, as long as you have a website for your app, you can upload the file and make it easier for your users to log in on additional devices. The file should be named <code>apple-app-site-association</code> with no extension, and is simple JSON. It should look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
  <span style="color:#f92672">&#34;webcredentials&#34;</span>: {

      <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;D3KQX62K1A.com.example.DemoApp&#34;</span>
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Inside the <code>apps</code> array, you should list all of the bundle identifiers for apps that should be able to share passwords from this site. The prefix to the bundle identifier is usually your Team ID. To be sure, pull up the app in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle">developer.apple.com</a> and copy the prefix from the App ID information.</p>

<h3 id="safari-password">Safari password</h3>
<p>Since we are focusing on retrieving passwords, and not saving them from the app, it will make testing easier to manually add the password to the device you are going to test on. I will include instructions for using the Simulator, but the same basic steps apply if you are using a physical device.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Settings app</li>
<li>Tap on “Safari”</li>
<li>Tap on “Passwords”</li>
<li>Enter <code>1234</code> for the passcode</li>
<li>Tap on “Add Password”</li>
<li>Enter your website and a user name and password</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>
<p>There are many approaches to retrieving the shared password. The method I have chosen is to make the call to retrieve the shared password when the user taps on the username or password field in the login form. That way, it is not as jarring for the user when first navigating to the form, but it is still helpful at the moment the user wants to take action.</p>
<p>The actual code for retrieving the credentials is fairly simple. Here is an example with a completion closure that returns an optional username and password.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span style="color:#66d9ef">func</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">requestSharedPassword</span>(completion: (username: String?, password: String?) <span style="color:#f92672">-&amp;</span>gt; ()) {

        <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span>
      }

    passwordField.text = password
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">self</span>.submit()
  }
}
</code></pre></div><h3 id="execution">Execution</h3>
<p>Finally, with the code in place, you can run the app again. When the user taps in the username or password field, call your <code>requestSharedPassword</code> function, and if everything is set up properly, you will see something like this example from an app I am currently working on:</p>
<p><a href="https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/4a1327e4a0.png">Shared credentials</a></p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>And that is it! These steps really are simple and straightforward, but the effect on the user experience of your app is tremendous.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As I approached the end of 2015, I was thinking of my goals for 2016, and how I wanted to grow and improve as a developer. One of the main areas in which I felt like I was lacking was in automated testing. That is a topic that many developers talk about, usually with a slight sense of shame, or a tinge of regret. There is almost always a tacit acknowledgement that it is important, and we should be doing it, but for many reasons, it is not happening.</p>
<p>As an iOS development community, we seem to largely have not yet embraced testing. There are many notable developers who are huge proponents of testing, but there seem to be even more who are not. I was talking with a Ruby developer about why that is. He commented that without tests, he has no way to know if his code is working—there is nothing he can easily pull up to see the code in action. With iOS development, we launch the simulator, and immediately conduct a manual test. So writing automated tests feels unnecessary.</p>
<p>One of the most common refrains that I hear is that writing automated tests feels like writing the app a second time, but with no obvious value to the end user. The conclusion to that line of thinking is that the time would be better spent building out more features that <em>do</em> benefit customers.</p>
<p>One experience that I had in late 2015 started to change my thinking about this. I participated in a <a href="https://startupweekend.org">Startup Weekend</a> event in Salt Lake City, and was on a team that built a bowling app for the then-yet-to-be-released Apple TV. I had never built a game before, and I was tasked with creating the actual game play—the bowling lane, pin, balls, and logic of the game. After diving into SceneKit and figuring out how to get the ball to go down the lane and knock over pins, I had to implement scoring logic, and reset the pins correctly based on the results of the frame. The logic was fairly simple, up until the tenth frame. I realized that it was going to be extremely difficult to manually test all of the different options. So I wrote a suite of automated tests to make sure that everything worked properly. That suite saved me a number of times as I would make a tweak for something like a strike or a spare, only to find out that I had broken part of the tenth frame logic.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2016, I started on a new team at my day job, and began working on a new project, <a href="/apps/align">Align</a>. We started with a quick prototype that had no automated testing. But as we began work on the real app, I took the time to set up a continuous integration build with <a href="https://jenkins.io">Jenkins</a> and <a href="https://fastlane.tools">Fastlane</a> that would run all of my tests and push to iTunes Connect for Test Flight. Then I began writing tests for every single thing that I implemented.</p>
<p>As I worked to maintain high test coverage, I found that writing automated tests, and thinking about writing automated tests did at least three things for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Knowing that I was writing tests made me write my code to be more testable, which helped it to be more modular and self-contained</li>
<li>Actually writing the tests helped me think of edge cases and error handling that I had not yet considered</li>
<li>Having tests already written helped me find small regressions as I made changes in the app</li>
</ol>
<p>I worked hard to make sure that all non-UI code was as completely covered with unit tests as possible. And then I wrote UI tests both to test the UI code, and also to serve as integration tests for the whole app. There were a number of configuration things that I had to set up, and I hope to discuss those in future posts. Having a comprehensive suite of unit and UI tests has already saved me from some major bugs. I have made significant changes to the architecture and organization of the project, and have been able to verify within seconds where I had introduced problems in the app, or verify with confidence that everything was still working.</p>
<p>One practice that I have been pushing myself to adopt more is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-driven development</a> or TDD. This has been most useful when discovering or hearing about a bug in the app. I write a failing test that highlights where the error is, and then write the code to fix the behavior. That way, I know when it is fixed, and that it will not break again in the future. When writing new code, TDD is often more difficult. I will create the basic objects that I need, and then write test methods whose names describe the behavior I want to have in the app. I will then add the property and functions necessary to define the API and write failing tests that illustrate what I expect to happen. Finally, I actually fill our the functions so that the tests pass. Invariably, there is some back and forth as I tweak the tests and tweak the code before everything is working properly.</p>
<p>Having a project with a robust test suite is such a comfort that I never want to go back. When I work on other projects that do not have tests in them, I start to get anxious and worry that I am breaking things without knowing about it. I have found that starting by adding some simple tests around any new behavior, or to illustrate bugs that are found is a great way to get started. You do not have to have the perfect project with complete test coverage in order to start reaping the benefits of automated tests. I look forward to learning more about testing and sharing more of what I am learning along the way.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>At the beginning of this year, I was put on a new team at work. We had the chance to a build a project completely from scratch. When I joined the team, they had already spent a few months interviewing potential customers and learning about the market, and were ready to build a prototype. I was tasked with creating a quick, simple version of the app that stored all data locally. I knew that I would be rebuilding the app a couple times, or at least refactoring major portions of the app. So I set out to build portions of the app in ways that I could easily reuse them multiple times, and across multiple projects.</p>
<p>One thing that has made this easier is that my employer has been generous in allowing large portions of my work to be open-source. As I worked on my project, I was conscious to separate app-specific code from reusable pieces that could be made into frameworks or libraries.</p>
<p>One of the first areas that I tackled was to create a network stack built on top of <code>NSURLSession</code> that provided a simple interface to make network requests. The end result is somewhat specific to our projects at O.C. Tanner, but we made it open-source in case it is useful to anyone else: <a href="https://github.com/octanner/ios-network-stack">ios-network-stack</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, I have made a number of libraries that I use across different apps. Most of the libraries are not to the level that I would like yet—I need to add automated tests, better code documentation, and useful readme files. But I have learned a number of things in creating and using these libraries, and thought it would be useful to go through some of the pros and cons.</p>
<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>
<h3 id="dependency-management">Dependency management</h3>
<p>For a long time, I resisted adding any dependencies to my projects. It felt much simpler to just focus on the project at hand, and build anything that was needed specific to the project. Dealing with a system such as <a href="https://cocoapods.org/">Cocoapods</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage">Carthage</a> felt like too much overhead. Part of my reaction came from working on projects where previous developers had pulled in so many dependencies that the project became unwieldy and difficult to update and maintain. We experimented with different approaches and finally landed on using Carthage and Git submodules, which I <a href="/2016/06/02/using-carthage-to.html">described earlier</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the key in managing dependencies reliably is being able to choose when to update those dependencies. If your code changes out from under you when you are not expecting it, development becomes much more difficult. Using Carthage and submodules means that I decide exactly when to update, and can choose which version of a given dependency to keep in my project. So if I need to use an older version for compatibility issues, or an experimental branch, that is easy to do.</p>
<h3 id="extra-time-cost">Extra time cost</h3>
<p>One of the biggest frustrations with adding dependencies is the additional time investment at the beginning of a project. Especially if something goes wrong, it can be extremely frustrating to want to just start coding, and instead have to deal with dependency problems.</p>
<p>Again, this is one of the reasons that I have decided on the system that I currently use. I use <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/">Tower</a> as a Git client, and it has made working with submodules extremely simple. If someone needs to check out the repo, they can just initialize the submodules, and they will have the entire project set up and ready to go. When starting a project, it is a simple process to set up the project, although there are a number of steps that can feel intimidating at first.</p>
<h3 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h3>
<p>One significant issue that you have to be aware of when creating open-source projects is the possibility that they will become successful. Once an open-source project starts being used by more people, and especially when they start contributing, it requires much more of a time investment. There will come pull requests to review and merge, issues to triage, and questions to answer. Hopefully this also comes with the benefit of having the code improved by getting more real-word usage, and contributions back to the project. But as the project creator, you have to evaluate whether the benefit will be worth the cost.</p>
<h2 id="pros">Pros</h2>
<h3 id="quicker-project-spin-up">Quicker project spin up</h3>
<p>In practice, I have found that the time balance comes out in favor of using dependencies. I only have a few third-party libraries that I am pulling in—many of my dependencies are internal libraries that I maintain and share across my projects. Splitting that code out into reusable libraries means that in each project, I can focus on the app-specific logic. I have been able to get new projects started much faster as a result.</p>
<h3 id="increased-testability">Increased testability</h3>
<p>Since I am using mainly internal libraries, this is code that I would have written anyway for each app. But since I am creating libraries, by necessity, it is decoupled from app logic, and more modular, making it easier to test. This has the benefit of creating more maintainable code and spending less time down the road debugging and fixing issues.</p>
<h3 id="community-contribution">Community contribution</h3>
<p>Even though many of my frameworks and libraries are only used by myself at this point, the fact that I am creating them as open-source projects means that they are available to the community. As I find interesting approaches to problems, or identify areas of boilerplate code that can easily be reused, it is a great feeling knowing that I am making it possible for others to benefit from that as well.</p>
<p>Of course, since I am still enjoying the <a href="/2016/05/31/the-luxury-of.html">luxury of obscurity</a>, I do not feel the pressure of having all of my projects perfectly documented, tested, and maintained. I still plan on working toward that goal, but I know I have time. At this point, creating reusable libraries has given me great personal benefit, and I look forward to helping others as well in the future.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After consuming much of WWDC last week, I wanted to take a few minutes and consider how my apps could be affected by the new announcements. Since I mostly sat in my office at home and watched live session videos, some effort is required to make sure that the videos can translate into action and improvement. I thought I would take each of my active projects in turn, or rather active and semi-active projects, and consider the state of the app, and how I might incorporate some new technologies. Most of this will be “thinking out loud” so that I can try and process some of what I learned.</p>
<h2 id="align">Align</h2>
<p>Align is a new app that I am helping create in my day job at <a href="http://labs.octanner.com/">Tanner Labs</a>. Our focus is to make managers better by leveraging the one-on-one. The tool will start out simple, as a way for managers to track one-on-ones and help them prepare, execute, and follow up. We will be launching this with both an iOS app and a web app, built on Firebase as a back end.</p>
<h3 id="sirikithttpsdeveloperapplecomsirikit"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/sirikit/">SiriKit</a></h3>
<p>One of the first thing that I thought of is the possibilities of integrating with Siri. As Apple expands Siri to be integrated with third-party apps, they are starting with six domains: messaging, voice/video calls, payment, ride sharing, workouts, and photo search. Of those, I think that messaging could potentially be a good fit.</p>
<h4 id="comments">Comments</h4>
<p>One of the keys with a one-on-one is the comments that can go back and forth between the manager and team member leading up to the meeting. That can help the team member to feel engaged and empowered to affect the content of the meeting, and to avoid anxiety or the “called-to-the-principal’s-office” feeling. Part of the challenge with integrating with SiriKit would be identifying which one-on-one to add comments to, so I think I would either have to default to the next one coming up, or consider scheduling one through the interaction. This kind of experience is not exactly what Apple seemed to have in mind, so I will have to explore it more and see how it might feel.</p>
<h4 id="coaching-items">Coaching Items</h4>
<p>An interaction that we have considered for Align is the ability for a manager to create a coaching item for a team member. This would be essentially a note that the manager creates to follow up with the team member on some point, whether to praise and recognize or to provide correction. The idea is that it should be an extremely quick interaction to capture something that would then be discussed later with the team member. This was actually one of the first things that came to my mind with SiriKit and Align, but as I think about it more, I think that it might not be the right fit. For the messaging domain, Siri is expecting to get a recipient from the user. The voice prompt would be something like, “Tell John using Align that…” The problem that I see is that the resulting action would be to create a coaching item for the manager to discuss with the employee later. It makes sense as a use case, but we will have to see if the interaction feels natural.</p>
<h3 id="imessage-apphttpsdeveloperapplecomimessage"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/imessage/">iMessage App</a></h3>
<p>Making Messages into a platform allows for much richer interactions that start while messaging with someone, and never leave that experience. I anticipate that some of the best implementations of this will be collaborative experiences, where the participants can go back and forth on something before it is finalized. This seems like it might be a great fit for preparing for a one-on-one. It would allow for a manager to send a team member the proposed agenda and other details for the one-on-one, and for the team member to have an easy way to provide input, or make suggestions to the agenda. This kind of interaction would require the team member to have the app as well, so we may or may not want to pursue this, but I think it could be powerful.</p>
<h3 id="notification-service-extensionhttpsdeveloperapplecomnotifications"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/notifications/">Notification Service Extension</a></h3>
<p>With iOS 10, notifications are now a powerful interaction point, and I want to make sure that we take full advantage of this. We will need to think through the design of a custom UI to show with notifications. We will have different kinds of notifications that users will receive, and each will have to be considered separately. One of the main things that should be featured in our notifications is the images of the team members involved in the notification. That will make it easy for a user to connect with the information and to encourage a personal approach.</p>
<h3 id="searchhttpsdeveloperapplecomiossearch"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/search/">Search</a></h3>
<p>In iOS 9, Spotlight integration was added, and this is definitely a feature that we should take advantage of. It should be simple for a user to find their one-on-one information by searching on the phone. With the addition of app search integration into Spotlight, this becomes even more compelling. As we build search into the app, I need to make sure that we do it in a way that we can easily facilitate this powerful interaction.</p>
<h3 id="watchos-3httpwwwapplecomwatchos-preview"><a href="http://www.apple.com/watchos-preview/">watchOS 3</a></h3>
<p>I have been planning on building some kind of Apple Watch app, although I am not sure exactly what the focus should be. However, with some of the changes in watchOS 3, I think the focus is much clearer. Since apps will stay “active” for eight minutes after launching them, it becomes much more feasible to have a Watch app be a reference point. If you are in a one-on-one, it could be powerful to have your agenda easily glanceable on your wrist so that you can be checking as you go to make sure that you both stay on time with the meeting, and cover everything you intended. A natural complication would be to see the next or current one-on-one, and that would make it easy to launch the app and be ready to execute the one-on-one. An implication of that interaction could be to make the agenda points completable, so that you could check them off as you go, in order to remember what is left. We will have to see where that goes.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Many of the system-level integrations in iOS 10 are focused around location- and communication-type apps, which does not exactly fit Align. For example, it would not make sense for Align to become the preferred messaging app for communicating with someone, and so I would not want to provide that information to Contacts. I need to make sure that I appropriately tag any input fields so that I can get meaningful Quick Type suggestions for things like people, contact information, or locations. I should also take advantage of the Universal Clipboard, and make sure that I am a good citizen there. I think that is about it for Align. Good stuff!</p>
<h2 id="pointedly">Pointedly</h2>
<p><a href="http://bsn.design/pointedly">Pointedly</a> is actually my first app released to the App Store, and continues to be one of my favorites to work on. It is a simple app to keep score in board games, or card games, or anything else that could use tracking. In many ways, it has served the purpose of being a playground for me to try out new technologies as they make sense for the app. It is currently a stand-alone app on the iPhone with the data not synced or shared in any way.</p>
<h3 id="cloudkit-sharinghttpsdeveloperapplecomicloud"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/icloud/">CloudKit Sharing</a></h3>
<p>This is huge for me. I have been wanting to build a back-end syncing mechanism for Pointedly so that you can easily track all of your games across your devices, but I have not implemented one yet. Part of the reason was that I wanted to be able to share games, and had not decided on the easiest way to do that yet. This feature is exactly what I was hoping for in CloudKit, without even thinking of it as a possibility. I had wanted to explore different options for collaborating on a pointcard, such as having it be public, and allowing anyone to join, or sharing with an individual. From the session explaining this, I think that I can accomplish exactly what I want while keeping the data private and only shared as needed. You can either share with a specified individual, or else anyone with the link so that you could post the link in some place like Slack for anyone to join that had access. There are still a number of things that I need to think through here, like how to share the players that are involved in a game, but this is definitely the answer for me.</p>
<h3 id="imessage-apphttpsdeveloperapplecomimessage-1"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/imessage/">iMessage App</a></h3>
<p>I am not completely sure about this yet, but I have been thinking that it would be fun to send someone a pointcard in Messages, and collaborate with them that way. It seems that there are a limited set of scenarios when this would make sense, and most of them would probably be better served by using CloudKit Sharing from within the app, but it remains an intriguing possibility. This is also a technology that I want to understand better, so in some ways I want to explore adding this just to gain experience with it.</p>
<h3 id="watchos-3httpwwwapplecomwatchos-preview-1"><a href="http://www.apple.com/watchos-preview/">watchOS 3</a></h3>
<p>Now that Apple Watch will have directly CloudKit support, and I will probably be adding CloudKit, this makes more sense. Combined with the enhancements to keep the app running for longer, using your watch to quickly enter the score for a game feels like a great feature. The crucial thing would be to figure out how to allow for a score entry that can easily be done in under two seconds. You have to select the player and input the score in the way that makes sense and then easily get an overview of the game progress. I will have to decide about creating a pointcard, and whether to allow that on the watch, or to require the iPhone for that. It seems like it would make more sense on the iPhone, but if I can find a fast way to do it on the watch, that would be nice. Finally, I think I would definitely want to use Handoff and encourage the user to go back to the phone to share the results at the end of the game.</p>
<h3 id="tvos-10httpwwwapplecomtvos-preview"><a href="http://www.apple.com/tvos-preview/">tvOS 10</a></h3>
<p>No customers have asked for this, and it would not make too much sense to invest a lot of time in developing this, but again, since tvOS supports CloudKit, it should be fairly simple to create a version to run on the Apple TV. I would have to possibly rethink some of the interactions to make them simpler, and consider having different views for the TV. For example, it might make more sense to have the Apple TV version be a display of the score that is entered from people’s iPhones or Apple Watches. But since they would all be getting their data from the same place, this could be compelling. Maybe I could develop simple charts that show the progress of the game in a meaningful way, or simply have a fun visualization of the current status of the game. It is at least something to consider.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts-1">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Most of the newly announced technologies in iOS 10 are not a great fit for Pointedly. One of my goals is to keep the app extremely focused and avoid letting it become bloated by trying accommodate everyone’s needs or adding features gratuitously.</p>
<h2 id="whimmy">Whimmy</h2>
<p><a href="http://whimmy.co/">Whimmy</a> is an app I created together with <a href="http://stotion.com/">Stotion</a> to make it easier to get together with the people that matter in your life. You can send an invite with a fuse that fills up once the capacity is reached and avoid the back-and-forth of text or email. The app is on iPhone, Apple Watch, web, and an Android beta.</p>
<h3 id="sirikithttpsdeveloperapplecomsirikit-1"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/sirikit/">SiriKit</a></h3>
<p>I was so excited to hear some of the details for SiriKit because I knew it would be a great fit for Whimmy. You would not necessarily use Whimmy as your preferred messaging app to contact someone because it is more focused around events. We designed it from the beginning to streamline the process of creating and responding to invites, and integrating with Siri is a natural extension of that. My only concern is honing the experience to get all of the right information through Siri. Currently, an invite includes recipients, message, location, capacity limit, and an expiration limit. That feels like a large number of data points to capture through Siri, so we will have to see how it feels.</p>
<p>One of the features that we have been thinking about adding to Whimmy is the ability to comment on an event. That would make for a powerful and quick interaction to use Siri to reply to an invite, or continue the conversation. Part of the challenge would be correctly identifying the correct invite for the comment from Siri, but that is something that we could hone through testing.</p>
<h3 id="notification-service-extensionhttpsdeveloperapplecomnotifications-1"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/notifications/">Notification Service Extension</a></h3>
<p>The ability to add custom UI to a notification when the user views the details is extremely exciting. For Whimmy, this would give us the ability to provide rich information when a recipient receives an invite, such as the people attending, potentially a map view of the location, and a visualization of the time remaining to respond. I love the challenge of figuring out how to build the designs that Stotion comes up with, and this would be another prime opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="custom-notification-responseshttpsdeveloperapplecomnotifications"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/notifications/">Custom Notification Responses</a></h3>
<p>One of the demos with the advances in notifications included a user responding to an invite. The actions for the notification were: Accept, Decline, and Reply. In the Reply action, the user could send a textual reply. One of the advances this year is that in addition to the text, I could build UI to allow the user to also accept or decline the invite. This is definitely something that I want to take advantage of with Whimmy as we build the commenting feature.</p>
<h3 id="imessage-apphttpsdeveloperapplecomimessage-2"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/imessage/">iMessage App</a></h3>
<p>If you already have a group message going with your friends, integrating Whimmy to create an event is a logical next step. As I mentioned earlier, we are planning to add comments to an invite, but that feature would not be needed in the context of the iMessage App version of Whimmy. You would already be chatting with your friends in Messages, and Whimmy would serve as a way for you to create an invite and easily allow your friends to respond.</p>
<p>It could make sense to send an invite to an individual person as well through Messages. You would want to be able to send the same invite to multiple people, so you would have to be able to choose from existing invites, or to create a new one. In some ways, this could easily feel redundant. Whimmy already allows you to send invites to people, even if they are not users of the app. I think we would need to do some user research to see how people would want to use the app.</p>
<h3 id="spritekithttpsdeveloperapplecomspritekit"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/spritekit/">SpriteKit</a></h3>
<p>This is not a new technology, but it is newly available on the Apple Watch, and something that I think we could take advantage of in Whimmy. With the expansion of SpriteKit to be on all iOS-based platforms (iOS, watchOS, and tvOS), this is a technology that I want to become more experienced with, even in UIKit-based apps. There are a number of animations that we use in the Apple Watch app of Whimmy, particularly in notifications, and we could convert those all to SpriteKit, and expand them to the rest of the app with good results.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts-2">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Whimmy has not been under active development for quite some time, but the potential is huge. I love the concept and believe in the purpose of getting people together more. It also serves as a great playground for me to experiment with different technologies and push myself as a developer. It does not make sense to invest a ton of time and effort into this app, but it is one that I really enjoy working on, and plan to consider for many of the announced changes.</p>
<h2 id="recite">Recite</h2>
<p><a href="http://bsn.design/recite">Recite</a> is an iOS app to facilitate memorizing scriptures, quotes, and other short passages. It is currently an iPhone app with an Apple Watch app, again with completely local data.</p>
<h3 id="cloudkit-sharinghttpsdeveloperapplecomicloud-1"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/icloud/">CloudKit Sharing</a></h3>
<p>This is another app for which I have wanted to add some kind of syncing. I built the app for my family to use in our morning devotional, and it has worked really well for that, as long as I am home. However, since it cannot be shared, my wife is not able to use it if I am not there, and I have wanted to fix that. So I think CloudKit Sharing will be a great fit here as well.</p>
<p>I am currently storing content packs as downloadable in-app purchases through Apple, and have been thinking that I might change the business model a bit. If I do, the public CloudKit database might be the right place to store the data to make it easily accessible to everyone. I want to think through this more, but I feel like CloudKit will play a large role in this app moving forward.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>iOS 10 and watchOS 3 provide some great opportunities for me to enhance the apps that I am working on already. It is probable that I will not be able to implement all of the ideas that I have had in this post, but this has been an extremely helpful exercise for me to consider each app in turn and think through the possible implications. I look forward to mastering some of these new technologies and adding them to my toolbelt so that I am ready to make use of them as I continue to create new apps.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As I <a href="/2016/06/02/using-carthage-to.html">discussed previously</a>, we are using Carthage and Git submodules to manage our dependencies. Since many of the frameworks that we are pulling in are frameworks that we are writing, we sometimes run into an issue where we have changed the version number of a release for a framework to be the same as a previous version. This does not happen often, but can happen if you have made a release, and then later deleted the release and the tag and made a new release pointing to a different commit.</p>
<p>The problem is that when you update a framework via a Carthage dependency, a local cache of the repo is saved, along with the version number tags. If you change your Cartfile to reference a version number that was previously downloaded, Carthage will use the locally cached version instead of getting the latest update from GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<ol>
<li>Using Terminal, navigate to the Carthage cache.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>cd /Users/[username]/Library/Caches/org.carthage.CarthageKit/dependencies</code></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Remove the directory matching the framework that you need to force to download.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>rm -rf FrameworkName/</code></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Back in your project directory, update again from Carthage.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>carthage update --no-build --use-submodules</code></li>
<li><em>Edit: <code>carthage checkout</code> works better for this. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/timshadel">Tim Shadel</a>!</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Your framework will download from GitHub at whatever version number you have specified, and you should be set. This is mostly a reference for myself for the next time that I need to remember how to do this, but hopefully it can help you as well.</p>

			 <p>In almost every project that I create, I bring in frameworks and libraries. After trying a number of different approaches to make this easier, I have landed on a system that uses <a href="https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage">Carthage</a>, and <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">Git submodules</a>. The system basically comes from <a href="https://gist.github.com/bwhiteley/aa571da100bca3a65c1f">a post by Bart Whiteley</a>, but I wanted to record all of the steps so that I have them in one place for my own reference.</p>
<p>The advantage of this system that you have all the control of submodules, while having the ease of using Carthage to keep dependencies in sync. You can easily change the version number of the dependencies in Carthage, and then commit the update to the submodule, making it easy to work across teams.</p>
<h2 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a workspace with your project included.
<ul>
<li>For help, look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-structure_navigator/articles/Creating_a_Workspace.html">Apple’s instructions</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set up a Cartfile with your dependencies.
<ul>
<li>For help, look at the <a href="https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile">Carthage documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Terminal, run the command <code>carthage bootstrap --no-build --use-submodules</code>.
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you have <code>carthage</code> installed (<a href="https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage">documentation</a>).</li>
<li>This will clone or fetch all of your dependencies, and check them out as git submodules in your project</li>
<li><em>Note:</em> You only need to run <code>bootstrap</code> once in your project. After that, you will run <code>carthage update --no-build --use-submodules</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="bringing-in-a-dependency">Bringing in a dependency</h2>
<ol>
<li>Find the FrameworkName.xcodeproj file for the dependency in .Carthage/Checkouts and add it to your workspace.
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you drag the project to the far left so that it becomes a workspace project instead of a subproject under an existing project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the General tab of your app target, add the framework to “Linked Frameworks and Libraries” by searching in the workspace.</li>
<li>The framework should show up in your Project Navigator. Drag it to a folder according to your project organization.</li>
<li>Add the same framework to “Embedded Binaries” in the General tab.</li>
<li>This will probably create a duplicate entry in “Linked Frameworks and Libraries” which you should remove.</li>
<li>Select the framework in the Project Navigator, and change the Location to “Relative to Build Products” in the File Inspector panel on the right.</li>
<li>Edit your project file (ProjectName.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj) in a text editor.
<ul>
<li>In the <code>PBXFileReference</code> section, find the entry for your framework.</li>
<li>Edit the <code>path</code> property to be simply <code>FrameworkName.framework</code>. You will probably be removing a long, absolute path reference.</li>
<li>The <code>sourceTree</code> property should be set to <code>BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the Build Settings tab of your app target, find the “Framework Search Paths” option. An entry pointing to the framework in .Carthage/Checkouts has probably been added, which you should remove.</li>
<li>Build the project and make sure there are no errors.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="additional-information">Additional information</h2>
<p>When someone else checks out the project, it is not necessary to run any <code>carthage</code> commands. Instead, they will update the submodules. This can be done in Terminal, if needed, using <code>git submodule update --init</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is always a challenge to find the best way to incorporate third-party code in a consistent, repeatable way that works well for individual developers as well as automated build systems. This has worked well for us, and hopefully will help you and your team as well.</p>

			 <p>As I was getting my blog ready, there was a large part of me that wanted to hold back until I had something meaningful to contribute. But there was another part of me that realized that at this point, it <em>doesn’t matter</em>. When I launch my blog, no one will notice. When I write a new post, I will be the only one that will care. If there are problems, or if there is something with which I am not happy, I can change it easily, and no one else will ever know.</p>
<p>This feeling of obscurity is simultaneously intimidating and empowering. I have already considered some of the empowering consequences, and now want to explore more of the intimidating aspects. When you know that almost no one will consume what you create, there is little incentive to deliver quickly. It can be extremely hard to build the discipline to start shipping.</p>
<p>So how do you conquer this?</p>
<p>One thing that I have learned in shipping my apps is that when you focus on creating something that is meaningful, people appreciate that. My first app, <a href="http://bsn.design/pointedly">Pointedly</a>, was a project that was part of my path in learning iOS development. I worked on it together with my 7-year-old son, and we used it often as a family, and my wife and I made decisions together about the business side of the app. Every time that we had a trade-off between making a solid business decision for ourselves or improving the user experience, we focused on the users. One example was the business model. Many people counseled me to either have a paid app, or require an in-app purchase to access all features. We decided instead to make the app completely free, and add in-app purchases to allow users to support the app with a tip. We have been pleasantly surprised that many people have been willing to give tips, and have left positive reviews.</p>
<p>I know that this isolated example will not hold true in all circumstances. But the lesson that I have taken away is that a focus on users will often be rewarded. Pointedly is not in a position to build a business on, and I am definitely not ready to support my family on the income from the tips, but it is a first step. The piece of the app that I hope <em>will</em> be the foundation for my business is a focus on users first. I firmly believe that when a business focuses on users and their needs above the needs of the business, the business will be more successful in the end.</p>
<p>To tie this all back together, even when you have no audience to receive your work, do your best work. Focus on improving the experience of your users, and when faced with a decision, choose your users. Start shipping, and as you ship, make sure that what you ship is work of which you can be proud. Allow the empowering effects of obscurity to drive you forward. Take advantage of the time you have to launch into obscurity, because there will come a day when you no longer have that luxury.</p>

			 <p>Back in January of 2016, I had a discussion with my manager and made some goals for the year. One of my main goals was to start blogging. I have been heads down on coding for the past year and a half, and had always meant to start recording some of thoughts and contributing back to the community, but just hadn’t started yet.</p>
<p>Part of me felt that I needed to gain more experience and learn more that was actually worthy of being shared. But then I noticed that many of the people that I was following, and that I respected most, were sharing concepts that they were just trying out, or that they were wanting to learn. I was especially inspired by <a href="https://www.natashatherobot.com">Natasha The Robot</a>, and her bite-sized posts that clearly explained different things she was figuring out.</p>
<p>As I continued to try new things out, and learn more about the craft of creating iOS apps, I started compiling a list of blog topics. Over the next few months, I hope to get in a habit of capturing my process, my goals, and my learnings along the way. At the very least, I will start building a repository of knowledge for myself to easily refer back to when I forget something that I have learned. Hopefully the things that I learn and that I share will be valuable to others as well.</p>

			 <p>Anyone who has ever searched for something related to web development has run into Chris. He runs the blog <a href="http://css-tricks.com">CSS-Tricks</a>, as well as <a href="http://codepen.io">Code Pen</a>, and the podcast <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com">Shop Talk Show</a>. He&rsquo;s like your own personal Mr. Miyagi in a can—always available to pop out when you need advice. He is now one of my heroes as he has unknowingly become something of a mentor on my path to front-end web development competence.</p>

<p>He was scheduled to be the second keynote address at the recent CSS Dev Conference, which I was invited to sketchnote. One of my goals in attending that conference was to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/zomigi">Zoe Gillenwater</a>, which I [wrote about]({% post_url 2013-12-07-meeting-your-heroes %}) recently. My other goal was to meet Chris Coyier. I started listening to and sketchnoting episodes of the Shop Talk Show a few weeks prior to the conference. One of huge interesting side effects of listening to someone over the course of a few hours is that you feel like you get to know them a bit. So I was excited to meet the man behind the voice.</p>
<p>The first night of the conference included a little history lesson on the Stanley Hotel. I went to the table where Chris was sitting and sat down next to him, and said something like, “You&rsquo;re Chris, right?” Very kindly, he replied, “Hey, it&rsquo;s Ben, right?” And my jaw dropped. The Chris Coyier knew who I was? I was stunned. I stammered out, “You know who I am!?” With great grace, he refrained from bursting out laughing, and pointed to the big name tag hanging around my neck. I started laughing at that point, and felt pretty foolish. Since I have four kids, and have seen the movie quite a few times, the scene from Cars flashed in my mind when the old rusty car with his name on his license plate freaks out that Lightning McQueen knows his name. Yeah, I was cool like him.</p>

<p>As Chris and I started chatting for a minute and I mentioned that I was there to sketchnote the conference, he recognized me from the sketchnotes I&rsquo;ve done from Shop Talk Show. We chatted about him having lunch with the legendary <a href="https://twitter.com/rohdesign">Mike Rohde</a>, the man who coined the term “sketchnotes” and who lives in Milwaukee as well. Over the course of the conference, we chatted a few more times, and I was impressed to find him a genuine, down-to-earth guy, despite being ridiculously famous in this little web-development world of ours (top nerd!?). And even better for me, he seemed remarkably willing to forget our meeting and still treat me professionally.</p>

			 <p>We all have moments that shape our lives to take us in different directions. For some people, it might be reading a particular book; for others, it might be hearing an influential talk; and for others, it might be just meeting someone. We often don&rsquo;t realize in the moment that we are being transformed, but as we look back on our lives, it is easy to pick out those turning points. It can be dangerous when those turning points are so closely aligned with people that they become heroes to us. The danger is that they are human, and the possibility of eventual disappointment is huge.</p>
<h2 id="exposition">Exposition</h2>
<p>I work for <a href="http://balsamiq.com">Balsamiq</a>, and every summer we all get together from our remote locations and have a week-long retreat. Last year it was in San Francisco, and one of our opening activities was to share a short slideshow of our heroes. One person commented that meeting your heroes can be a real let-down. He showed a slide he had made a few years earlier of his heroes, and then showed how many of them had been crossed off the list for one reason or another. One of the biggest reasons for the X’s was that he had actually met many of them, and they turned out to not be anything like what he thought.</p>
<h2 id="rising-action">Rising Action</h2>
<p>For me, a specific turning point was the <a href="http://environmentsforhumans.com/2012/responsive-web-design-summit/">RWD Summit 2012</a>, a web conference all about Responsive Web Design. I was a UX Designer on a team without front-end web developer, and was struggling to find a way to help get my designs implemented. I had no experience coding HTML or CSS to that point, and had heard the buzzwords “Responsive Web Design” thrown out, but they always seemed to mean something different each time I heard them.</p>
<p><a href="https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2018/2f4f403338.jpg"><a href="https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2018/2f4f403338.jpg"

</a></p>
<p>There were two specific talks at that conference that seemed to open a door for me. The first was “Building a Responsive Layout” by <a href="https://twitter.com/zomigi">Zoe Gillenwater</a>. She showed how simple it was to build layouts that were not based on fixed widths, but rather on fluid percentages that could even be nested. She introduced concepts to me such as “mobile first” and “progressive enhancement” in a practical way that I could immediately see how to apply them. Because she combined solid theory with live examples, I felt like I truly understood what the foundations of responsive web design meant, and felt ready to apply them immediately in my own work.</p>

</a>

</a></p>
<p>The second talk that struck me was “Retrofitting Sites for Responsive Web Design” by <a href="https://twitter.com/bencallahan">Ben Callahan</a>. He walked through the practical example of making the Twitter site responsive as we watched, using the Chrome Dev Tools. That showed me even more some of the basic properties involved in making a site responsive. I also realized that I could start playing with those tools right away to learn different CSS properties, and understand what they meant by seeing what they did when changed.</p>
<p>That insight opened the floodgates for me. I went back to my team and started inspecting the pages after they had tried to implement my design, and I would tweak it and them email them the line number and the CSS code that I wanted changed. Eventually, I got set up to write the code from the beginning, and thus began my journey into becoming a front-end designer. Since that time, I have progressed to writing production-level code, and have been able to design and code a few sites by hand, including my own site with two different skins.</p>
<p>Fast forward to Fall 2013, and I found myself anticipating meeting the two people I hold responsible for getting me into front-end development, Zoe and Ben. The kind folks from <a href="http://environmentsforhumans.com/">Environments for Humans</a> had me out to sketchnote the <a href="http://2013.cssdevconf.com/">CSS Dev Conference</a> at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, and the <a href="http://artifactconf.com/">Artifact Conference</a> at the Biltmore Hotel in Providence, Rhode Island. I set as my goal before the conferences to try and meet Zoe and Ben, as well as <a href="https://twitter.com/chriscoyier">Chris Coyier</a>, although meeting him is a [different story altogether]({% post_url 2013-12-08-my-own-cars-moment %}).</p>
<h2 id="climax">Climax</h2>
<p>The first night of the CSS Dev Conference included a tour of the haunted hotel that inspired The Shining, and I found myself walking next to none other than Zoe Gillenwater. I introduced myself as the guy there to sketchnote the conference and was shocked when she responded with something like, “Yeah, I know you! I love your sketchnotes!” We started chatting for a minute, this keynote-speaking, book-writing hero of mine and me, and found that we had a lot in common. We both have young kids, we are both passionate about learning new things, and we are both <a href="http://www.mormon.org">Mormon</a>. Over the next few days of the conference, we had a few opportunities to chat, and we talked about how she got into web development, how she started writing and speaking, as well as fun random stuff about having a young family and trying to figure out a career and balance home life. I left the conference feeling like I had a new friend, which blew all my expectations out of the water.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, I was landing at the airport in Providence, RI, and as I got picked up and driven to the hotel, I rode with, you guessed it, Ben Callahan. We chatted briefly then, and off and on throughout the conference, but didn&rsquo;t get much time to talk until dinner on the last night. I’ll talk more about that dinner in a minute, but it gave me the chance to sit next to Ben and just talk about his life and his journey to where he is now. Again we found much in common with raising small kids, balancing a career, and learning and growing while giving back. I was so inspired by what he has been able to accomplish.</p>
<h2 id="falling-action">Falling Action</h2>
<p>At dinner that last night in Providence, I had been invited to come out with the workshop presenters and the conference organizers. I felt a little bit like the little kid at Thanksgiving who is invited to the grown-ups’ table for the first time. There were so many people that I admired and respected there. As we talked, it was kind of funny how the circle of inspiration had gone around the group. Brad Frost talked about his experience meeting Jen Simmons for the first time, and realizing that she was the one who wrote “that cool web book.” He said if it wasn&rsquo;t for her, he wouldn&rsquo;t be doing what he is now. Ben Callahan shared a similar experience about meeting Christopher Schmitt for the first time. And I was thinking about how it was happening for me! Right then! I wouldn&rsquo;t be there if not for Ben Callahan, and I was sitting right next to him as if I had some right to be there! I kept my thoughts to myself that night, just happy to be at the table. Maybe next time we are all together, I can share my story.</p>
<h2 id="dénouement">Dénouement</h2>
<p>One of the biggest takeaways from my conversations with both Zoe and with Ben was to start writing. That is the best way to start sharing knowledge and experiences, and begin contributing to this living, growing community we are lucky to be part of. Even if we aren&rsquo;t already all that we want to be, it is helpful to everyone if we document the process along the way to get there. So here&rsquo;s hoping I (and all of us) can stay consistent in sharing lessons, mistakes, and successes.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This post wraps up my series of sketchnotes created for The Company Corporation (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Incorporate.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). The event was a Q &amp; A session with Brandon Steiner of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->steinersports.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and went through lessons he learned as an entrepreneur. The session contained tons of great information for small business owners, but was a challenge to sketchnote. All of the other sessions in this series were prepared presentations, so they had a structure, and a natural flow. But this one was more organic, with stories illustrating unconnected points. So the process that I took was different from what I have used with most events, and I thought it would be interesting to share.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I watched the broadcast once in its entirety without capturing any sketchnotes just to get a feel for the content. That helped me realize the approach I wanted to take. Similar to my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sketchnotes for the Raising Capital webinar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I wanted to try a different layout than what I have typically used. So when it came time to actually sketchnote the event, I left lots of white space and captured main ideas from the stories presented as usual, but I worked in more of a popcorn layout. As new ideas came up, they just popped onto the page without following a set order or pattern. For a linear presentation where the ideas build on each other, a sketchnote using this structure would be harder for someone reading it to follow, but since the ideas were loosely connected if at all, this worked well.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Once I was finished with the event, I went back and added some color and some emphasis to the title. With a non-standard layout, the title needed to pop a bit more than normal. Usually, this will be the final step for me. I prefer to do as much as possible live during the event, and will often add color highlights as I go if I&rsquo;m going to use them in a sketchnote. Since these sketchnotes were for a paying client, I wanted to take a bit more time on each of the stages so that the end result would be the best that it could be.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to try something else new and add some embellishments. There was so much great content and I wanted to convey that sense immediately. The clean layout that I had with lots of the white space works well for many situations, but I wanted something more. So I went back to the presentation and added some additional points that I didn&rsquo;t capture during the first pass. I also added illustrations for some of the original points until I felt like I had the effect that I wanted. Since this was pushing me out of my comfort zone a bit, I scanned in the sketchnote at each of the stages, so that if I was dissatisfied with how things turned out, I had something to fall back on. But in the end, I felt that I had a product that worked well and was something I could be proud of.</p>
<p>Hopefully this glimpse into my creative process was interesting for you and sparks ideas for things you could try!</p>

			 <p>The third installment of the series for The Company Corporation (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Incorporate.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) was another fantastic resource for small business owners. This was focused on how to raise capital for your business, and making sure that you have considered all of the ramifications.</p>
<p>I had noticed that my sketchnotes had all been in the same basic layout: top to bottom and left to right in something of a &ldquo;Z&rdquo; pattern. So this time I tried a completely different layout, and I loved it! Doing something different pushed me a bit out of my comfort zone, and I was pleased the with end result.

			 <p>Last April, I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->posted<!-- raw HTML omitted --> my sketchnotes from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LDS General Conference<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the first time. This time around, I decided to not sketchnote during the actual conference. I decided that it had the tendency to make me irritable when one of our four young kids would talk to me or interrupt me in some way. I was too stressed about capturing the talks.</p>
<p>The answer to my dilemma also came from my experience last conference. Because I do Romanian interpretation for some of the sessions, I listed to and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sketchnoted those sessions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> after the fact. This conference I decided to take that approach with every session.</p>
<p>So this is the Saturday morning session; the first in a five-part series as I capture each session and post it here. Hope you enjoy it!</p>

			 <p>I was thrilled to have the opportunity to present on sketchnotes at the annual <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SORT conference<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I have had the chance to present on sketchnotes across the country, and found that the same question seemed to come up every time, &ldquo;How do I get started?&rdquo; In this presentation, I lay out what sketchnotes are, why they are so valuable, when and where you can use them, how to do them, and who can do them. There is even a hidden bonus on how to draw stick figures! I thoroughly enjoyed creating and delivering this presentation, and hope that it could help a few more people dive into the blissful world of sketchnotes.</p>

			 <p>Now that I work for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I have the opportunity to attend a yearly conference put on by employees, for employees. This was my first opportunity to attend, and I had a great time! There was a huge variety of classes available, so every participant could find information that was relevant and useful. For me, this naturally meant two days of sketchnoting! Below are the notes I took, broken out by session. I also was lucky enough to be able to present about sketchnotes, and you can read more about that here: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sketchnote Presentation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>I had the fantastic opportunity to participate in a wonderful virtual conference on Responsive Web Design by Environments for Humans. Sadly, I came in at the tail end of the first session, but I was able to catch all the others.I have played with responsive design a bit and just finished designing a site that is responsive. But I still didn&rsquo;t have the fundamentals down of what it takes to design well for a responsive site. This summit helped fill in the gaps for me and I feel prepared to take on the world! My favorite thing was seeing some of the principles in action during the talks. Particularly with Zoe and Ben, they showed us what it was like to design responsively from the beginning or with an existing site. It was great!</p>
<p>Here are my sketchnotes from the event:</p>

			 <p>Last week, I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->posted<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about how being a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mormon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> meant that I was able to participate in a semi-annual General Conference. This week, I am posting about how being a Mormon means that I had the chance to participate in a very different conference. Every year for the past three years, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (the official name of the Mormon church) has held an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LDS Tech Conference<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This is a gathering of volunteers who come together to meet with employees to learn about the technology efforts of the LDS Church as well as to contribute to ongoing projects.</p>
<p>I attended this year for the first time and was richly rewarded. The conference spanned Wednesday evening through Friday afternoon, with a keynote address Wednesday, various presentations and speakers in the mornings, and then the chance to work on volunteer projects each afternoon. It was exciting to me to see all the different efforts that are underway to give more church members access to meaningful experiences through the use of technology. I also enjoyed the chance to truly contribute during the course of the conference. It will be great to see how things move forward, and I look forward to participating again next year.</p>
<p>Included here are my sketchnotes from the event.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mormon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. That means so many things, but this last weekend, it meant that I was able to participate in a semi-annual world-wide General Conference. Every April and October, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (the official name of the Mormon church) has five two-hour sessions, spread over Saturday and Sunday. It is a fantastic opportunity for us to come and be instructed further about the doctrine that we believe in, and to take a moment to pause from our hectic lives to concentrate on things that really matter most.</p>
<p>For over ten years, I have taken extensive notes at each conference. A couple years ago, those notes transformed into some of my earliest sketchnotes. I have kept that tradition up this year as well, even when it meant using my phone as a small red flashlight because the lights were all turned off in the meetinghouse. Yes, I am a nerd. But I love doing sketchnotes!</p>
<p>In addition to sketchnoting most sessions, I also have the opportunity to participate directly in the conference as a Romanian interpreter. Each language team is a little bit different, but for our team, that means that I get the English text for the talks a week or so in advance of the conference, and the Romanian text anywhere from a few hours to a few days beforehand. I prepare delivering the text, so that when the talk is given, I perform a simultaneous reading, striving to match the speed, tone, and style of the speaker. The most important aspect is to convey the feeling of the message and provide an experience for those who listen in Romanian that is as close as possible to those who listen in English. My favorite part is when speakers like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->President Thomas S. Monson<!-- raw HTML omitted --> give a talk, because you never know how much they will stick to the text, and how much they will speak extemporaneously and require live interpretation.</p>
<p>General Conference is significant as a logistical feat—providing access in 93 languages to reach most of the 14,441,346 members around the world. But the most important part is the chance to hear from living prophets, the same as if Moses or Abraham was alive to give us insight into how to live our lives better. What a unique opportunity! I am grateful to have been part of it. Now comes the real challenge: putting all these great messages into practice!</p>
<p>Here is a fantastic infographic from the official <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lds.org site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about the conference (click to see more).</p>

			 <p>March 2012 marked the second annual Early Education and Technology for Children (EETC) Conference put on by the Waterford Institute. Since I work for Waterford, I had the opportunity to attend the conference. It was a fantastic gathering of people who were focused on how to improve the education and lives of children through the use of technology. I captured each of the keynote and featured speakers in sketchnotes and wanted to make them available. I look forward to a great conference again next year!</p>

			 <p>I love to write. Not the novel-creating, prize-winning kind of writing, just the act of scratching a pen across paper. Growing up as a child, I wrote all kinds of things and found that I enjoyed playing with letters. My dad is something of an artist, and I always dreamed that I would be too, but that seemed to elude me. Writing though—that was something I could do. My penmanship improved in direct proportion to the number of girls that I &ldquo;fell in like&rdquo; with as I wrote each one fresh new reams of notes expressing my undying, albeit fleeting, affection.</p>
<p>Formal education was the perfect forum to develop my love for writing. I had a different notebook for each subject, and took notes in every class. I would like to think that I also reviewed those notes at some point, but I wouldn&rsquo;t swear to that. The more I had to write, the smaller my writing got, and I felt a great sense of accomplishment at using a fraction of the paper that other people used. This wasn&rsquo;t due to an over-zealous eco-friendly bent, but sadly just to my pride. I got a sense of sick pleasure at the look of shock on people&rsquo;s faces as they saw my notes, though their shock was probably more that someone would invest so much time and energy into something that then required even more time and energy to try and read later!</p>

<p>As I got to college, I started taking notes outside of classes as well. It got to be something of a guilty obsession. I carried around a pocket notebook, and recorded particularly meaningful conversations or my thoughts and impressions of lectures, talks, even Sunday School classes. This was all separate from my journal, which I also kept regularly. I created a cover for my pocket notebook to help it last longer, and used a small laminated sheet behind the paper to make sure that I had a hard surface so I could write smaller.</p>

</a>

<p>After I was married, my wife encouraged me to focus on developing my own style of stick figures or something equally simple. I began illustrating my planner with small, simple pictures and found that I loved doodling as much as writing. I graduated my pocket notebook to a small Moleskine that didn&rsquo;t require my creating an additional cover, and started incorporating small doodles into my notes there as well. These became my first sketchnotes, long before I had heard that term, or knew that it was now socially acceptable.</p>

</p>
<p>My journey was nearing its natural arrival to the blissful land of official sketchnoting. Dan Roam&rsquo;s book, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Back of the Napkin<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, freed me to start doodling and sketching at work. If anyone laughed or asked what on earth I thought I was doing, I had a published work to cite as evidence. I began seeking out opportunities to incorporate pictures into my work, and it became the running joke on my team to guess how long it would be into a meeting before I got up to the whiteboard and starting drawing something.</p>

</a>

<p>I started following Dan on Twitter and through him, I found mention of a clandestine movement called… sketchnoting. He unknowingly led me to a video of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eva-Lotta Lamm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> describing how she does sketchnoting, and the planets aligned. I had found my calling. Since then, I have transformed my work notebook into a sketchbook and began enjoying meetings much more. I also have a Moleskine dedicated to events that merit sketchnotes, whereas I use my other notebooks to practice with different meetings or events that I don&rsquo;t actually want to capture and remember. One of my new favorite pastimes is browsing other peoples' work on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sketchnote Army<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The remarkable thing to me has been the way that people resonate with sketchnotes. People at work ask if they can sit next to me during company meetings so that they can watch me take notes. My kids even like to look at what I have done at work because there are fun pictures. Hopefully you connect with them as well. If so, come back often and I will keep posting my latest sketchnotes. Even better, give it a try yourself!</p>

			 <p>During the day, I masquerade as a Product Owner and UX Designer for a non-profit educational software company. This week I had the opportunity to attend a webinar put on by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hatch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> called &ldquo;Teaching in the Digital Age: Smart Tools for Early Learners.&rdquo; Brian Puerling from the Catherine Cook School in Chicago presented about how his school has been able to integrate technology effectively.</p>
<p>One point he made repeatedly resonated with me, and that is that technology should not be used for its own sake. This is true in all industries, but especially in education. There should be a purpose and a goal to every activity, and then technology can become a tool to help facilitate that purpose.</p>
<p>Some of the examples that Puerling gave struck me as fascinating. Even in working with preschool students, they are able to use technology as a way to open up possibilities and allow them to express themselves creatively. Students collaborate to create eBooks which are then published and presented at a publishing party to parents. Students works with a &ldquo;tech buddy,&rdquo; older students who serve as mentors on how to use technology, and in turn have tech buddies of their own. After studying a book or particular author, they have a Skype interview with that author and allow the students to connect in an extremely personal way.</p>
<p>Driving all of these examples was a concerted effort with dedicated planning to ensure that the outcomes would match the intended goal. This webinar was a great reminder of all the possibilities that technology offers educations, but also that only its deliberate use in proper situations will produce meaningful results.</p>
<p>Included here are my sketchnotes.</p>

			 <p>This second installment of my Stanford Human-Computer Interaction course went in a totally different direction. Where the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->first lecture<!-- raw HTML omitted --> focused around the efforts and experience of a single individual, this second lecture took a much broader look at changing landscape of technical production. The lecture was titled &ldquo;Burning Man at Google, A Cultural Infrastructure for New Media Production?&rdquo; and was given by Fred Turner.</p>
<p>The main point that I took away from this lecture is that the phenomenon of commons-based peer production is starting to change our industry completely. Products like Wikipedia, Linux, and many others are built on the efforts of volunteers, many of whom are highly skilled and are contributing in a different kind of economy than ever before. Contributors are not paid, and so this is driving a new kind of community where people build on each other&rsquo;s strengths and skills without thought of compensation. As more companies recognize and start to harness the potential of this kind of production, projects of a different nature and scale will become our new reality.</p>

			 <p>Every once in a while, you make a discovery that makes you feel as if you have been living under a rock. For me, this happened last week as I discovered iTunes University. I had no idea that colleges and universities all over the country have been making premium learning available for free. Economics classes have always taught, &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no such thing as a free lunch,&rdquo; but this proves them wrong! I found a seminar series from Stanford University on Human-Computer Interaction, so this will be the first in a ten-part series.</p>
<p>In this first installment, Dr. Shumin Zhai spoke on progressive user interfaces. He has been involved in the research and development of the gesture keyboard, an on-screen keyboard that allows for words to be drawn as a gesture instead of tapped out. The fundamental design principle that he discussed was the tension between ease and efficiency.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ease<!-- raw HTML omitted --> refers to a design that allows a user to walk up to a new interface and use it without problem. It is a recognition task, so as a designer, you are building on what a user already already uses or intuitively knows. This is the principle behind the modern graphical user interface (GUI) that is largely responsible for the explosion of the personal computer.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Efficiency<!-- raw HTML omitted --> refers to a design that requires minimal effort. This is a recall task, so it relies on users learning the action to the point where they can perform it without instructions or scaffolding. This is embodied in the world of command-line computing where users can quickly perform tasks, but are required to independently remember the syntax required. A more everyday example of this design is keyboard shortcuts. Some people use these obsessively while most others never bother.</p>
<p>In the battle between ease and efficiency, ease almost always wins. This is mostly due to the fact that we typically value today&rsquo;s time over that of tomorrow. So for a designer, the secret is to find a way to naturally move users from ease to efficiency. This is the task that Dr. Zhai set out to accomplish with the gesture keyboard, and he shared the principles behind this transition.</p>
<p>In order to move users from ease to efficiency, two things are required: information redundancy and chunking. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Information redundancy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> basically means building in practice. Users have to perform the same actions over and over, and as they do, they can move from recognition to recall. Recall is much more efficient but also more cognitively demanding. With <!-- raw HTML omitted -->chunking<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Dr. Zhai found that people learn things in chunks, not discrete items. So to have the greatest effect, the practice should be with chunks of information.</p>
<p>The great challenge for designers now is to explore ways to help users move from ease to efficiency in all different contexts. Sometimes it won&rsquo;t be possible however, and in those cases, we need to design for users at both ends of the spectrum. As previously mentioned, ease almost always wins over efficiency, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to completely replace efficiency.</p>
<p>Take a minute to look through my sketchnotes for more detail.</p>

			 <p>I am a nerd. I take notes in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars Moleskine notebook<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and can&rsquo;t wait for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lego Moleskines<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to come out. I also have a decent collection of gadgets—I currently use an iPhone, an iPad, a Macbook Air, a Macbook Pro and an iMac. So a national Digital Learning Day is a great thing in my eyes. My department at work all tuned in for the broadcast of the national town hall.</p>
<p>The event was hosted by former West Virginia governor, Bob Wise, and began with a short discussion featuring Arnie Duncan, the U.S. Secretary of Education, and Julius Genachowski, FCC Chairman, and then moved to Skype calls with schools around the country. It was a feel-good celebration of current efforts at the high school level to integrate technology more into the school day. However, our company is focused on early education, and there was nothing discussed for the elementary school level, so we skipped the last half hour. Overall, I wholeheartedly support this event and hope that this movement of incorporating effective technology into our school system continues to gain momentum.</p>
<p>Here are my sketchnotes of the event.</p>

			 <p>The most challenging and difficult occupation today is that of parent. Similar to most jobs, you are expected to learn mostly through on-the-job training, except that the training part is a misnomer. You have no supervisor, no one checks your work, there are no performance reviews; in short, you are completely on your own. Of all the things that might be required in our education system, somehow these skills were left out.</p>
<p>I attended a parenting class taught by Kathy Andrizzi on January 27, 2012, and have been digesting it since. The class was based on the principles taught in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Positive-Parenting-Wonderful-Children/dp/1567131751">The Power of Positive Parenting</a></em>, written by Kathy&rsquo;s uncle, Dr. Glenn Latham.</p>

			 <p>A few months ago, we started adding to our Product Management group at my day job. Previously, I was the only Product Owner, and I was swamped. Many people were confused about how we were going to structure our group and how they would work together with us. I created a presentation to explain how things were before our change, and how we expected them to become with the additions to our group.</p>
<p>I decided that the presentation should be one that I enjoyed creating, and hopefully everyone else would enjoy seeing as well. I grabbed a couple introductory images for each section, but then hand-drew all the rest of the images. There are almost no words in the slide deck, and it purposely does not stand on its own. This is not a slideument—a term coined by <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com">Garr Reynolds</a> to describe a slide deck that is really a document. Without my presenting, the slides alone don&rsquo;t make sense. Although I only included a few example slides here, the half-hour presentation contains almost 200 slides. Instead of creating complicated builds and animations on a few slides, I constructed the builds over the course of a few slides, and move through them quickly. The result is a deck that I enjoy and has been effective in explaining our organization and process.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over the past couple months, I have been playing around in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to try and create the site that I had in my mind. I was referred to WordPress by a friend and have been thrilled with what I found. I thought I would chronicle my journey to finally creating the menu of my dreams.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->#menu {
background: url(&quot;<a href="http://benjaminsnorris.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/presentations-design-sketchnotes-header.png">benjaminsnorris.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/p&hellip;</a>&quot;) no-repeat scroll 5px -40px transparent;
height: 125px;
}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.menu-navigation-container {
margin-top: 95px;
}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next, I extended the canvas of my image by a factor of three (for me that meant going from 140 pixels to 420 pixels). Then I selected everything that I had created so far and duplicated it twice. I took one of the duplicates and dragged it to the very bottom, and the other went in the middle. Tis meant I ended up with three rows of my images and page titles.</p>
<p>Finally, I got down to the real work. The final row was going to become the selected state for me, and that was going to be easier. I just wanted to change the color of the image as well as the page title. The middle row was to become the rollover state. I changed the color of the text, but the images we more complex. This needed to be fun to use, so I wanted to add a little something to each of the images. I sketched out ideas in paper with a Sharpie, and then when I had what I liked, I scanned it in, played in Photoshop until it worked with what I already had, and then I was set. That was the fun part!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying this as well, it&rsquo;s important to note the size of each piece of your sprite. I already knew the height of each row, but I needed to determine the width of each menu item as well. You&rsquo;ll want to write down the width for each item, as you need it in the final step.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->#menu li {
float:left;
position:relative;
display:inline;
}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->#menu li:hover &gt; a,#menu ul ul :hover &gt; a {
color:transparent;
}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->#menu ul li.current_page_item &gt; a,#menu ul li.current_page_ancestor &gt; a,#menu ul li.current-menu-item &gt; a {
color:transparent;
}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->#menu {
width:800px;
list-style:none;
height:140px;
}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->#menu li a {
height:140px;
float:left;
color:transparent;
}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->/<em>Specify the piece of the image that should display for the Home menu item in its normal state</em>/
#menu-item-59 a {
width:75px;
background:url(&lsquo;<a href="http://benjaminsnorris.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/presentation-design-sketchnote-menu.png'">http://benjaminsnorris.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/presentation-design-sketchnote-menu.png'</a>) no-repeat scroll 0 0 transparent;
}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->/<em>When the user rolls over Home, the image should jump down to the second line</em>/
#menu-item-59 a:hover {
background-position:0 -140px;
/<em>These are X, Y coordinates. So the image starts from 0 (the left edge), but down 140 pixels, and is going to show 75 pixels over since that is the width</em>/
}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->/<em>And finally when Home is selected, the image should jump to the third line</em>/
#menu-item-59.current-menu-item a {
background-position:0 -280px;
}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>You do the same thing for each menu item. The only thing that will change for each is the X coordinate for each item. It will simply be the X coordinate of the previous item minus that item&rsquo;s width. So, my second menu item is at -75px 0px, or 75 pixels to the right of the top left corner. My third menu item is at -200px 0px, and so on. Do that for each item, and you are set!</p>
<p>The finishing touch was spacing out the menu items, and making sure that only the right pieces of the image were displayed. My last bit of CSS code did just that.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->#menu a {
margin:4px 6px;
padding:0;
}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

		<a href="https://micro.bennorris.com/2011/12/19/basic-and-enhanced.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2011-12-19 08:08:15 -0600">Dec 19, 2011</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I am pretty sure that making mockups for fun classifies me without question as a nerd, but I&rsquo;ve come to grips with that. I took an existing website, <a href="https://www.lds.org">www.lds.org</a>, and created the mockups that you see below. They clearly illustrate the difference between <strong>basic</strong> and <strong>enhanced</strong> mockups.</p>
<h2 id="basic-mockups">Basic mockups</h2>
<p>The purpose of basic mockups is similar to a sketch on a whiteboard, or a piece of scrap paper. You want to get something visual as quickly as possible so that it is easier to talk about it. Sometimes you need to explain your idea to someone else, and you know that a simple visual aid will help immensely. Other times, you want to explore the functionality of a site or application, and want to keep people focused solely on the function, not on the form. By using a fantastic tool such as <a href="https://www.balsamiq.com">Balsamiq Mockups</a> that looks hand-drawn, you are able to keep people focused on what matters most. I have found these to be effective even in conducting some basic usability testing to see if people are able to use your application the way you intend. Iterating at such an early stage saves you significant time and money down the road.</p>
<h2 id="enhanced-mockups">Enhanced mockups</h2>
<p>The purpose of enhanced mockups is to show that you have a solid idea that is well on its way to becoming reality. This is still not the final version, so as you are discussing it with people, their focus is not on the skin, but rather on the content and functionality. This is a great way to iterate with your graphic designer as you explore the layout and basic look and feel of your site. I have seen that people look at an enhanced mockup and fill in the final polish with their minds, so it allows them to avoid fixating on a small detail that you have done differently than they were expecting. At the same time, they are able to recognize that you are close to implementing something and they can get excited about the end product.</p>

<p>As part of a community-university partnership, I was part of a group that did an evaluation of the <a href="http://www.nhutah.org">Neighborhood House</a> in preparation for accreditation review by <a href="http://www.naeyc.org">NAEYC</a>, the National Association for the Education of Young Children.

<p>This slide deck was the introduction and beginning of the curriculum for an economics course at the University of Utah. I was asked for help, and decided to invest more time into recreating this deck because it would set the stage for the rest of the course. By pulling most of the text off the slides and into the notes, the presenter still has all the information, but the audience is not trying to read and listen at the same time.</p>

			 <p>In my day job, I am a Product Owner and UX Designer for a non-profit educational software company, <a href="https://www.waterford.org">Waterford Institute</a>. In 2010, we tackled an ambitious release of our core educational product. I led a complete redesign of the teacher management interface. Our previous interface had been built over the course of many years, with new features being tacked on wherever possible. We started from the ground up, analyzing the primary jobs that educators needed to perform, and then designing an application to make those jobs quick and simple.</p>
<p>Included here are some screens from the previous version and mockups of the redesigned interface.</p>

			 <p>Home education is something that we have been thinking about doing for a while, but after a lackluster kindergarten year, we decided it was time. Following many hours researching different curricula, approaches, and methods, we are using the Charlotte Mason method. She prescribes more of a philosophy about how children should learn, and it fit us and our family well. We found a great website, <a href="http://www.amblesideonline.org">Ambleside Online</a>, that has taken the ideas of Charlotte Mason and devised a curriculum that we have found to be extremely helpful.</p>
<p>To kick off our first year, on 4 Jun 2011, we attended the annual Utah Home Education Association convention in Salt Lake City, UT. There were a number of great breakout classes to choose from, and we felt like it was well worth our time in attending.</p>
<p>I captured the different sessions in sketchnotes and thought I would share them here:</p>

			 <p>All these years of waiting, and I have finally arrived online! This will be my first stab at a website as I gain some more mad skills and figure out how all of this works.</p>
<p>Expect this to change regularly, hopefully for the better. Stay tuned!</p>
