The ambiance was charming and welcoming, but that wasn’t my favorite either.<br><br>I loved the menu. With all my heart.<br><br>More precisely, I loved the menu covers.

(For more on office hours, see <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90610764/completely-had-it-with-email-give-personal-personal-office-hours-a-try\">this excerpt</a> from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525536558/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0525536558&amp;linkId=b21bad29be593b14442630aa5d3e5612\"><em>A World Without Email</em></a> on the topic.)</li><li>If you have a topic you want to discuss with a group of your colleagues, instead of gathering them all together in a new meeting, you instead visit each of their office hours one-by-one to talk it through.</li><li>In many cases, these one-on-one conversations should be sufficient for you to reach a resolution on the issue, or at the very least, reduce it down to a very targeted set of questions that can be much more efficiently addressed.</li></ul></blockquote><div><br>There are so many things that we can and need to do in order to reduce the overwhelming number of meetings many of us participate in.

				"content_html": "<p>A huge part of seeing and treating others as people, as well as increasing efficiency and productivity, involves understanding when to communicate asynchronously, and when to be synchronous.</p>\n<p>We often default to ways of communicating that reduce others to objects and decrease their and our ability to work well. We are inundated with information, and yet spend little time considering different modes of communication and deliberately deciding which to employ.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"tldr\">tl;dr</h2>\n<p>Default to asynchronous communication to honor others as people, improve critical thinking, and increase productivity.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Asynchronous most of the time, synchronous when needed</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive summary</h2>\n<p>Many different methods of communication exist, and we should be thoughtful about which one we choose to use for a given moment.</p>\n<p>Synchronous, or real-time communication expects immediate responses. This includes forms such as meetings, drive-by interruptions, and chat pings. Benefits include speed, information density, and impacts on relationships. Costs include treating people as objects, less critical thinking, and productivity losses.</p>\n<p>Asynchronous communication decouples the message and response. Forms include email, chat, and long-form writing. Costs include delays, possible misinterpretation, and additional required skills. Benefits include slowing down, respect, and productivity increases.</p>\n<p>Organizations should find a balance in synchronicity. I recommend four concrete steps to improve communication. First, establish cultural norms explicitly. Second, hold fewer better meetings. Third, move more to asynchronous communication. And fourth, establish a single shared repository for information. As part of these recommendations, I strongly encourage that email is eliminated as an internal communication method.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"full-thoughts\">Full thoughts</h2>\n<h3 id=\"synchronicity-definitions\">Synchronicity definitions</h3>\n<p>I want to start with the distinction between synchronous and asynchronous communication. Here are my own definitions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Synchronous.</strong> Real-time communication where the delay between a message and response is expected to be next to nothing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Asynchronous.</strong> Communication where the message and response are decoupled. The sender has no expectation that the receive will reply immediately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"communication-methods\">Communication methods</h4>\n<p>As part of defining synchronicity, I think it is useful to identify some of the methods we use to communicate with others. Here is a possible hierarchy, from the most synchronous to the most asynchronous.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Planned in-person conversation</li>\n<li>Shoulder-tapping</li>\n<li>Planned video call</li>\n<li>Planned audio call</li>\n<li>Unplanned call</li>\n<li><em>Personal text message</em></li>\n<li><em>Direct chat message</em></li>\n<li><em>Mention in group chat</em></li>\n<li><em>Request through workflow process</em></li>\n<li><em>Message in group chat</em></li>\n<li><em>Personal email</em></li>\n<li><em>Group email</em></li>\n<li>Mention in wiki<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></li>\n<li>Wiki post in monitored space</li>\n<li>Wiki post in unmonitored space</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where I have seen the most problems is in the emphasized middle section. This is due to a mismatch in expectations. One person may expect an immediate response and become frustrated at any delay, where the other person thought that they could respond when convenient.</p>\n<h3 id=\"synchronous-communication\">Synchronous communication</h3>\n<p>In many organizations, the default method of communicating has become synchronous. We often talk about the work instead of doing the work.</p>\n<h4 id=\"meetings\">Meetings</h4>\n<p>Meetings appear to be the most efficient way to gather information, or align a group. Meetings are held to get status updates, or communicate direction and vision for a project. We come together to brainstorm or to make decisions. We call groups together so that no one is left out or lacking important details about something that might affect them. In a meeting-addicted culture, we default to “getting the right people together” in order to solve something. As I will discuss later, there are many hidden costs to meetings that we rarely consider when scheduling or hosting them.</p>\n<h4 id=\"drive-by-interruptions\">Drive-by interruptions</h4>\n<p>When people are colocated, there can be a temptation to walk over to someone and ask them a question directly. We often preface this interruption with a platitude, “Sorry to interrupt, but…” or “Quick question for you…” or “Do you have a minute?” This kind of interaction is insidious, because it appears to be efficient. The needed information or decision is received quickly, and then both people can move on with their work without being blocked. I will address some of the true costs in a minute.</p>\n<h4 id=\"chat-ping\">Chat ping</h4>\n<p>Whether we are colocated or remote, the chat ping is one of the most frequently used forms of hidden synchronous communication. One person reaches out to another using some electronic tool with a question or request for a decision, and has the expectation of an immediate response. The expectation is not always made explicit, but is often made clear through repeated or impatient follow-up messages. Again, this interaction has the appearance of efficiency, with the true costs being hidden beneath the surface.</p>\n<h4 id=\"synchronous-benefits\">Synchronous benefits</h4>\n<p>Part of the reason that we engage in synchronous communication so often is that there are many benefits, both real and perceived. I want to explore three of those benefits.</p>\n<h5 id=\"speed\">Speed</h5>\n<p>When we come together and work through an issue or discuss a problem or brainstorm a solution, we are able to accomplish more in a shorter period of time. For emergency situations, this is vital. We do not have time to go back and forth and get everyone’s opinion or thoughts—we need to act.</p>\n<p>Some of the situations that most benefit from being able to move forward more quickly are brainstorming and decision-making. When we are in a divergent phase of ideas where we want to explore more, coming together can facilitate this. People are inspired by others, and have ideas sparked by those that they hear, and we are able to generate many more ideas. When a decision needs to be made, it is often most efficient to finalize the discussion together and then have the person responsible make the final call.</p>\n<h5 id=\"information-density\">Information density</h5>\n<p>Another benefit of synchronous communication is that we are able to take in more information at the same time. As humans, we are wired to process non-verbal cues alongside any explicit information that is being transferred. Having the opportunity to see and hear others as ideas are discussed or opinions are shared provides the ability to take in more information than would otherwise be possible.</p>\n<h5 id=\"impact-on-relationships\">Impact on relationships</h5>\n<p>We are social creatures. We connect to others through seeing and hearing each other, and even more so by being physically present. Whether we are on a phone call, a video call, or together in person, we have the chance to strengthen the bonds between us. Through active listening, we can demonstrate to the other person that they matter to us, and they can see in a literal sense that we care about them.</p>\n<h4 id=\"synchronous-costs\">Synchronous costs</h4>\n<h5 id=\"people-as-objects\">People as objects</h5>\n<p>The first cost of defaulting to synchronous communication is that we view others as objects. Instead of respecting their needs and priorities, we impose our will on them. We value our time and our efficiency over theirs. We reduce others to repositories of information, or decision-making vending machines.</p>\n<h5 id=\"less-critical-thinking\">Less critical thinking</h5>\n<p>Synchronous situations are more charged and potentially stressful. We require those present to think through the matter at hand immediately and be able to share their thoughts. Some people thrive in this environment. Many people do not. Nearly all of us benefit from having time to collect our thoughts and deeply review the information that is relevant to whatever we need to discuss.</p>\n<h5 id=\"productivity-losses\">Productivity losses</h5>\n<p>I mentioned before that defaulting to synchronous communication has the appearance of efficiency and productivity. This is an illusion.</p>\n<p>When we gather a group together for a meeting, it can seem as if the meeting was a simple one hour event. But in reality, if ten people attend, it was a ten hour meeting. We fail to consider the opportunity cost of having those people stop whatever they were doing in order to participate.</p>\n<p>Another major problem with a meeting is the limiting effect it has. Meetings give privileged access to the attendees that is not afforded to current or future team members that may be in need of that access.</p>\n<p>Part of the productivity hit that comes from an interruption is the recovery time. Every employee can benefit from uninterrupted focus time to consider their work and how they might approach it better. Having dedicated blocks of uninterrupted time is even more vital for knowledge workers. Many people in provide the most value through creative problem solving. Having meetings or other interruptions destroys a person’s ability to focus deeply.</p>\n<h3 id=\"asynchronous-communication\">Asynchronous communication</h3>\n<h4 id=\"methods\">Methods</h4>\n<p>There are different forms of asynchronous communication available to most workers. There are three that I want to mention separately.</p>\n<h5 id=\"email\">Email</h5>\n<p>The most common form is email. This is the tool that many people naturally employ in order to reach someone else, either to provide or to request information. It is a simple, ubiquitous way to communicate with others.</p>\n<h5 id=\"chat\">Chat</h5>\n<p>Many organizations adopt some form of instant messaging software to allow employees to reach others more directly. This is a fantastic way to reach others when used properly and recognized as an asynchronous tool. It can also turn into an all-day meeting where attention and focus are constantly interrupted.</p>\n<h5 id=\"long-form-writing\">Long-form writing</h5>\n<p>Many organizations also have some kind of wiki or shared repository of information. In the best environments, everyone can access all content, except sensitive information that needs to be protected.</p>\n<p>As compared to the previous two of email and chat, long-form writing has the effect of helping the creator solidify their thoughts more fully. When this writing is in a shared space, it also leads to greater access and can empower people to accomplish more on their own.</p>\n<h4 id=\"asynchronous-costs\">Asynchronous costs</h4>\n<h5 id=\"delays\">Delays</h5>\n<p>One of the first problems that most people see with asynchronous communication is an increase in overall time. Because answers are not immediately provided, people are waiting more often. This can lead to decisions being held up, or people wasting their time waiting on others. As I will explore later, this is not all bad, but it is a very real cost and needs to be considered.</p>\n<h5 id=\"possible-misinterpretation\">Possible misinterpretation</h5>\n<p>Many of us have had the experience of sending someone an email or a text, and having our intent completely misunderstood. Written communication can lack some of the nuance that is conveyed in facial expressions, body language, or tone of voice. If we are not careful, moving more to asynchronous communication can result in colder relationships or conflicts, whether perceived or real.</p>\n<h5 id=\"more-skill-required\">More skill required</h5>\n<p>Not everyone is a skilled writer. Many people struggle to be concise in writing, and are not practiced at sharing their thoughts in a coherent way. Taking the time to write out our thoughts can have the effect of crystallizing our thinking, which can help us deliver it more clearly, whether through writing or not. But a very real cost of moving to more asynchronous communication is that people will need to practice more and become more skilled at sharing their thoughts in written form. This can take time, and can be frustrating to some people.</p>\n<h4 id=\"asynchronous-benefits\">Asynchronous benefits</h4>\n<p>Asynchronous communication is not always the best or the right fit, but it can have many advantages.</p>\n<h5 id=\"slowing-down\">Slowing down</h5>\n<p>One of the first is that it is often slower. At first glance, this seems like more of a disadvantage, but in most cases, it leads to better outcomes. Take the example of an important decision. Our instinct may be to call a quick meeting of everyone involved or affected and come to a decision so that it can be implemented. In a true emergency situation, this is exactly what we should do. But most of the time, we benefit by slowing down the process and giving those involved time to consider the situation and the implications of different courses of action. This leads to a better decision in the end.</p>\n<h5 id=\"respect\">Respect</h5>\n<p>Another major advantage of defaulting to asynchronous communication is the respect it demonstrates to other people. In this way, we truly see and value others as people, and do not reduce them to objects. We recognize that they will have their own needs and priorities that may or may not align with ours. When we communicate in a way that allows others to process and address our message at a time that works best for them, we honor them and improve our relationships.</p>\n<h5 id=\"productivity-increase\">Productivity increase</h5>\n<p>A natural consequence of these first two advantages, and an advantage in its own right, is an overall increase in productivity. In the case of decision making, being able to make a better decision the first time means that there will be fewer negative consequences and time lost revisiting the issue down the road. In the case of information requests, an individual is able to find out information by themselves without having to ask anyone. This preserves the time and attention of the person who is the potential source of the information, as well as the person who needs the information. This empowers people to more easily solve problems by themselves.</p>\n<h3 id=\"recommendations\">Recommendations</h3>\n<p>Overall, my strong recommendation is that organizations and individuals find a healthy balance between synchronous and asynchronous communication. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, or magic formula that will work for everyone. As with most things, the best results often come from a middle path where we avoid extremes in either direction.</p>\n<p>That being said, I believe that this general rule is helpful:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Asynchronous most of the time, synchronous when needed</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have a few concrete recommendations that build on each other, starting with the simplest and most immediate and moving to the most involved and potentially challenging.</p>\n<h4 id=\"establish-cultural-norms\">Establish cultural norms</h4>\n<p>My first recommendation is the easiest to implement. I shared earlier a list of different <a href=\"#communication-methods\">communication methods</a>. Individuals, teams, departments, and even the organization as a whole can create a list of the communication methods they choose to follow in. Additionally, this list can establish expected response times.</p>\n<p>An example is as follows:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Method</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">When appropriate</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Expected response time</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Repeated calls</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Emergency situation</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Immediate to a few minutes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Direct call</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Urgent situation</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Immediate to an hour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Direct message/mention</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Timely response needed</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Within half a day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Wiki comment</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Important decision</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Within one business day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Wiki mention</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Information request worth saving</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">One to three business days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Group message</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Non-urgent one-off information request</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">One to three business days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Wiki post</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Information sharing</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Within one week if needed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">External email</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Communication outside organization</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">One to three business days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Internal email</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Not appropriate</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">No response expected</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Establishing and publishing such a list can help build a culture that prioritizes meaningful work and creates space for people to do that work. This can also ensure that needed information flows throughout the organization and becomes increasingly available for everyone who might need it.</p>\n<h4 id=\"fewer-better-meetings\">Fewer better meetings</h4>\n<p>My second recommendation is to improve the quality of our meetings. Too often, we get together just because of tradition, or because it seems to make sense that we should get a few people together. We lack purpose and clarity in why we are meeting, and we invite too many people.</p>\n<p>We need to meet less often. And when we do meet, we need to have a clear purpose. One simple approach is to start the meeting with a question, and when that question is answered, stop the meeting.</p>\n<p>We need to weigh the benefits and costs and consciously choose that a meeting is the best way to achieve our desired outcomes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"move-more-to-asynchronous\">Move more to asynchronous</h4>\n<p>My third recommendation is that we start defaulting to asynchronous more of the time. A practical example of that would be to use chat tools more often, and to consider them as truly asynchronous tools. Instead of messaging people directly, ask your question in a space where multiple people could see it and answer, and then move on to other things that you need to do. Get in the habit of not expecting an immediate answer.</p>\n<p>The necessary corollary to this is that we become more reliable at checking in on messages that we have received and responding in a timely manner. If we are in a role that needs to provide information to others to unblock them, we respect them by checking more regularly and responding more quickly. But we still honor ourselves and those we help by focusing on the deep, meaningful work we can do most of the time, and spend less of our time responding to interruptions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"single-shared-repository\">Single shared repository</h4>\n<p>My next recommendation is to reduce the number of tools used for communication, and particularly the places where people need to look for information. The first and most pressing need is to eliminate email as a communication method as much as possible. Email is inherently limiting while also producing noise and distraction. When important information is communicated via email, it is available only to those who received the email. Because of this, often too many people are included in an email to mitigate the risk of excluding someone. This is a pernicious practice that perpetuates exclusion and pulls people away from their most important work.</p>\n<p>In my previous recommendation, I stated that more communication should happen via chat. Here I want to go a step further and say that our most important communication should happen in a shared space such as a wiki. If we reach decisions in chat, they should be recorded in the wiki. Even better, longer discussions and decisions can be reached in the wiki itself. We can make use of commenting features to allow people to share their thoughts and ideas in the context of the necessary information. This encourages people to take the time to form their thoughts, and to share a complete thought rather than a line at a time.</p>\n<p>One crucial aspect to this is standardizing on the repository for this important information. Too often, different departments each store their information in a way that is traditional for them, and so information is scattered across many different tools. An organization has to be willing to prioritize effective communication and invest the time and money in selecting, promoting, and using a shared tool.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Communication is central to all that we do as people, particularly in the workplace. The methods that we choose to employ, and the habits that we form will dictate the kind of work that we are able to perform. Synchronous communication has a valuable place, but when it is overused, drastic consequences can follow. Asynchronous communication as the default respects people as people, creates space for critical thinking, and increases productivity. Choose to value the people currently in your organization, and those that will join later by committing to communicating asynchronously more often.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>This step should be higher in the hierarchy in my opinion, but this represents a practical assessment of how I have seen messages and responses handled.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>",
				"content_text": "A huge part of seeing and treating others as people, as well as increasing efficiency and productivity, involves understanding when to communicate asynchronously, and when to be synchronous.\n\nWe often default to ways of communicating that reduce others to objects and decrease their and our ability to work well. We are inundated with information, and yet spend little time considering different modes of communication and deliberately deciding which to employ.\n\n<!--more-->\n***\n\n## tl;dr\n\nDefault to asynchronous communication to honor others as people, improve critical thinking, and increase productivity.\n\n> Asynchronous most of the time, synchronous when needed\n\n***\n\n## Executive summary\n\nMany different methods of communication exist, and we should be thoughtful about which one we choose to use for a given moment.\n\nSynchronous, or real-time communication expects immediate responses. This includes forms such as meetings, drive-by interruptions, and chat pings. Benefits include speed, information density, and impacts on relationships. Costs include treating people as objects, less critical thinking, and productivity losses.\n\nAsynchronous communication decouples the message and response. Forms include email, chat, and long-form writing. Costs include delays, possible misinterpretation, and additional required skills. Benefits include slowing down, respect, and productivity increases.\n\nOrganizations should find a balance in synchronicity. I recommend four concrete steps to improve communication. First, establish cultural norms explicitly. Second, hold fewer better meetings. Third, move more to asynchronous communication. And fourth, establish a single shared repository for information. As part of these recommendations, I strongly encourage that email is eliminated as an internal communication method.\n\n***\n\n## Full thoughts\n\n### Synchronicity definitions\n\nI want to start with the distinction between synchronous and asynchronous communication. Here are my own definitions:\n\n> **Synchronous.** Real-time communication where the delay between a message and response is expected to be next to nothing.\n\n> **Asynchronous.** Communication where the message and response are decoupled. The sender has no expectation that the receive will reply immediately.\n\n\n#### Communication methods\n\nAs part of defining synchronicity, I think it is useful to identify some of the methods we use to communicate with others. Here is a possible hierarchy, from the most synchronous to the most asynchronous.\n\n- Planned in-person conversation\n- Shoulder-tapping\n- Planned video call\n- Planned audio call\n- Unplanned call\n- *Personal text message*\n- *Direct chat message*\n- *Mention in group chat*\n- *Request through workflow process*\n- *Message in group chat*\n- *Personal email*\n- *Group email*\n- Mention in wiki[^1]\n- Wiki post in monitored space\n- Wiki post in unmonitored space\n\nWhere I have seen the most problems is in the emphasized middle section. This is due to a mismatch in expectations. One person may expect an immediate response and become frustrated at any delay, where the other person thought that they could respond when convenient.\n\n\n### Synchronous communication\n\nIn many organizations, the default method of communicating has become synchronous. We often talk about the work instead of doing the work.\n\n\n#### Meetings\n\nMeetings appear to be the most efficient way to gather information, or align a group. Meetings are held to get status updates, or communicate direction and vision for a project. We come together to brainstorm or to make decisions. We call groups together so that no one is left out or lacking important details about something that might affect them. In a meeting-addicted culture, we default to “getting the right people together” in order to solve something. As I will discuss later, there are many hidden costs to meetings that we rarely consider when scheduling or hosting them.\n\n\n#### Drive-by interruptions\n\nWhen people are colocated, there can be a temptation to walk over to someone and ask them a question directly. We often preface this interruption with a platitude, “Sorry to interrupt, but…” or “Quick question for you…” or “Do you have a minute?” This kind of interaction is insidious, because it appears to be efficient. The needed information or decision is received quickly, and then both people can move on with their work without being blocked. I will address some of the true costs in a minute.\n\n\n#### Chat ping\n\nWhether we are colocated or remote, the chat ping is one of the most frequently used forms of hidden synchronous communication. One person reaches out to another using some electronic tool with a question or request for a decision, and has the expectation of an immediate response. The expectation is not always made explicit, but is often made clear through repeated or impatient follow-up messages. Again, this interaction has the appearance of efficiency, with the true costs being hidden beneath the surface.\n\n\n#### Synchronous benefits\n\nPart of the reason that we engage in synchronous communication so often is that there are many benefits, both real and perceived. I want to explore three of those benefits.\n\n##### Speed\n\nWhen we come together and work through an issue or discuss a problem or brainstorm a solution, we are able to accomplish more in a shorter period of time. For emergency situations, this is vital. We do not have time to go back and forth and get everyone’s opinion or thoughts—we need to act.\n\nSome of the situations that most benefit from being able to move forward more quickly are brainstorming and decision-making. When we are in a divergent phase of ideas where we want to explore more, coming together can facilitate this. People are inspired by others, and have ideas sparked by those that they hear, and we are able to generate many more ideas. When a decision needs to be made, it is often most efficient to finalize the discussion together and then have the person responsible make the final call.\n\n\n##### Information density\n\nAnother benefit of synchronous communication is that we are able to take in more information at the same time. As humans, we are wired to process non-verbal cues alongside any explicit information that is being transferred. Having the opportunity to see and hear others as ideas are discussed or opinions are shared provides the ability to take in more information than would otherwise be possible.\n\n\n##### Impact on relationships\n\nWe are social creatures. We connect to others through seeing and hearing each other, and even more so by being physically present. Whether we are on a phone call, a video call, or together in person, we have the chance to strengthen the bonds between us. Through active listening, we can demonstrate to the other person that they matter to us, and they can see in a literal sense that we care about them.\n\n\n#### Synchronous costs\n\n##### People as objects\n\nThe first cost of defaulting to synchronous communication is that we view others as objects. Instead of respecting their needs and priorities, we impose our will on them. We value our time and our efficiency over theirs. We reduce others to repositories of information, or decision-making vending machines.\n\n\n##### Less critical thinking\n\nSynchronous situations are more charged and potentially stressful. We require those present to think through the matter at hand immediately and be able to share their thoughts. Some people thrive in this environment. Many people do not. Nearly all of us benefit from having time to collect our thoughts and deeply review the information that is relevant to whatever we need to discuss.\n\n\n##### Productivity losses\n\nI mentioned before that defaulting to synchronous communication has the appearance of efficiency and productivity.

Having dedicated blocks of uninterrupted time is even more vital for knowledge workers. Many people in provide the most value through creative problem solving. Having meetings or other interruptions destroys a person’s ability to focus deeply.\n\n\n### Asynchronous communication\n\n#### Methods\n\nThere are different forms of asynchronous communication available to most workers. There are three that I want to mention separately.\n\n##### Email\n\nThe most common form is email. This is the tool that many people naturally employ in order to reach someone else, either to provide or to request information.

I shared earlier a list of different [communication methods](#communication-methods). Individuals, teams, departments, and even the organization as a whole can create a list of the communication methods they choose to follow in. Additionally, this list can establish expected response times.\n\nAn example is as follows:\n\n| Method | When appropriate | Expected response time |\n|:--|:--|:--|\n| Repeated calls | Emergency situation | Immediate to a few minutes |\n| Direct call | Urgent situation | Immediate to an hour |\n| Direct message/mention | Timely response needed | Within half a day |\n| Wiki comment | Important decision | Within one business day |\n| Wiki mention | Information request worth saving | One to three business days |\n| Group message | Non-urgent one-off information request | One to three business days |\n| Wiki post | Information sharing | Within one week if needed |\n| External email | Communication outside organization | One to three business days |\n| Internal email | Not appropriate | No response expected |\n\nEstablishing and publishing such a list can help build a culture that prioritizes meaningful work and creates space for people to do that work. This can also ensure that needed information flows throughout the organization and becomes increasingly available for everyone who might need it.\n\n\n#### Fewer better meetings\n\nMy second recommendation is to improve the quality of our meetings. Too often, we get together just because of tradition, or because it seems to make sense that we should get a few people together. We lack purpose and clarity in why we are meeting, and we invite too many people.\n\nWe need to meet less often. And when we do meet, we need to have a clear purpose. One simple approach is to start the meeting with a question, and when that question is answered, stop the meeting.\n\nWe need to weigh the benefits and costs and consciously choose that a meeting is the best way to achieve our desired outcomes.\n\n\n#### Move more to asynchronous\n\nMy third recommendation is that we start defaulting to asynchronous more of the time. A practical example of that would be to use chat tools more often, and to consider them as truly asynchronous tools. Instead of messaging people directly, ask your question in a space where multiple people could see it and answer, and then move on to other things that you need to do. Get in the habit of not expecting an immediate answer.\n\nThe necessary corollary to this is that we become more reliable at checking in on messages that we have received and responding in a timely manner. If we are in a role that needs to provide information to others to unblock them, we respect them by checking more regularly and responding more quickly. But we still honor ourselves and those we help by focusing on the deep, meaningful work we can do most of the time, and spend less of our time responding to interruptions.\n\n\n#### Single shared repository\n\nMy next recommendation is to reduce the number of tools used for communication, and particularly the places where people need to look for information. The first and most pressing need is to eliminate email as a communication method as much as possible. Email is inherently limiting while also producing noise and distraction. When important information is communicated via email, it is available only to those who received the email. Because of this, often too many people are included in an email to mitigate the risk of excluding someone. This is a pernicious practice that perpetuates exclusion and pulls people away from their most important work.\n\nIn my previous recommendation, I stated that more communication should happen via chat. Here I want to go a step further and say that our most important communication should happen in a shared space such as a wiki. If we reach decisions in chat, they should be recorded in the wiki. Even better, longer discussions and decisions can be reached in the wiki itself. We can make use of commenting features to allow people to share their thoughts and ideas in the context of the necessary information. This encourages people to take the time to form their thoughts, and to share a complete thought rather than a line at a time.\n\nOne crucial aspect to this is standardizing on the repository for this important information. Too often, different departments each store their information in a way that is traditional for them, and so information is scattered across many different tools. An organization has to be willing to prioritize effective communication and invest the time and money in selecting, promoting, and using a shared tool.\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCommunication is central to all that we do as people, particularly in the workplace. The methods that we choose to employ, and the habits that we form will dictate the kind of work that we are able to perform. Synchronous communication has a valuable place, but when it is overused, drastic consequences can follow. Asynchronous communication as the default respects people as people, creates space for critical thinking, and increases productivity. Choose to value the people currently in your organization, and those that will join later by committing to communicating asynchronously more often.\n\n\n[^1]: This step should be higher in the hierarchy in my opinion, but this represents a practical assessment of how I have seen messages and responses handled.\n",

				"content_text": "I loved this article studying how the voices of women can be better fostered and heard: [When Women Don't Speak](https://magazine.byu.edu/article/when-women-dont-speak/).\n\n> The bottom line, if you want to empower women, apply majority rule when women have the numbers and unanimous rule—or at the very least, an underlying principle of unanimous rule, hearing from everyone—when they don’t.\n\n<!--more-->\n***\n\nAs a father of four girls, I find myself thinking a lot about gender roles and how to teach them, and my three boys, how to confront bias, whether conscious or not.

I was thrilled last week when my wife found and shared this article with me because she knew how much I care about this.\n\nThe answer to improving the gender gap is not necessarily always in raw numbers.

To be a good fit depends mostly on personality and slightly on style and type of work. In order for someone to be well-suited for remote work, it is often ideal for them to possess the following characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Honest and mature—able to work effectively without direct supervision</li>\n<li>Intrinsically motivated</li>\n<li>Capable of independent thought and work</li>\n<li>Not completely dependent on work for social interaction</li>\n<li>Disciplined and able to stop working when needed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Often, people get concerned that employees who work from home will shirk work and spend more time watching TV or attending to personal matters or taking naps. In most cases, the real problem with employees' work/life balance is that work encroaches on all other areas of life which leads to burnout. Generally, if leaders cannot trust their people to work, it does not matter where they are doing that work. If that is a concern of ours, I think it is a much bigger issue.</p>\n<p>Often the best fit for style and type of work include some or all of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creativity or problem solving</li>\n<li>Deep thought and consideration</li>\n<li>Individual contribution</li>\n<li>Occasional collaboration</li>\n<li>Information sharing or data transfer</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"problems-with-colocated-work\">Problems with colocated work</h3>\n<p>Not everything about colocated work is bad—there are many positives, and many benefits that come from this kind of work better than in any other way. As humans, we are designed to be social creatures, and processing the rich input stream of emotional and nonverbal communication that comes from being in person with someone is huge.</p>\n<p>However, in a professional sense, there are many potential challenges. One of the first is that being physically close establishes a default of synchronous communication. This encourages shoulder-tapping, and fosters a culture of ASAP, where people become accustomed to getting answers immediately. At first glance, this may appear to be positive—we can seem to be more efficient, and in some cases, we truly are in the short-term. The insidious truth about this environment is that it is inherently selfish. Instead of seeing others as people, we see them as objects that exist to provide us with information or to get us unstuck when we feel the need. Instead of sitting in our own discomfort of not knowing something immediately, or searching it out ourselves, or just waiting until it is convenient and productive for the other person to respond, we place our own needs above theirs. This can lead to an almost unconscious perspective of viewing others as objects instead of people.</p>\n<p>Another major problem with primarily colocated work is the cheapening of in-person interactions. I think many of us have noticed the inverse of this through our experience with the current pandemic. Because we have been isolated, those instances where we are able to be in person with someone are truly valued. Many people experience this as well when living away from family or friends—we often see loved ones less, but value the experience more. When I worked for a fully-remote company, we found this to be extremely true. We had an annual company retreat where we all gathered together for a week and a half, and would have mini retreats once or twice a years as smaller teams. Those times were special to build and strengthen relationships and create memories, and greatly enhanced our ability to work remote effectively.</p>\n<p>The final problem with colocated work that I have seen is the illusion of control or involvement. For much of human history, there has been something seductive about being able to see people in order to know that they were behaving as we expected. In the workplace, we can, sometimes unconsciously, associate someone being at their desk as them working or being productive. This is a horrible measure of productivity. Again, it reduces people to objects, and tells them that their worth to the company is not the value they provide, but the hours they spend in a certain location. When this illusion is removed, it requires leaders to step up and discern how to measure the value that employees provide, both to track their productivity, and to help them grow as individuals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-successful-remote-work-looks\">How successful remote work looks</h3>\n<p>In my experience, when everyone is colocated, we think less about how successful work looks, but when we consider remote work, it becomes top of mind. I think we should take advantage of the situation we are in to consider how we could be more successful in general. I want to share my opinions on how successful work looks. It so happens that working remotely encourages these behaviors and characteristics.</p>\n<p>The first and most important point is that people are respected as people, and their time and attention is valued and carefully protected. We all recognize and appreciate the value that each person provides, and take the time to learn how others work, and how we can best interact with them to respect and empower them. In practice, this often looks like waiting more often. Instead of demanding that people stop what they are doing in order to deal with us and our needs, we carefully consider first whether we actually need to interrupt them. If we determine that it is necessary, we do so in a way that allows the person to continue what they are doing, and respond when it is convenient for them. Inversely, we respect the requests from other people, and respond as quickly as appropriate. If we are in a position or a role where we need to provide more time-sensitive information, we respect others by checking more regularly to see if there are requests to which we need to respond.</p>\n<p>A related principle is that we communicate asynchronously most of the time, and move to synchronous when needed. There are situations, such as debates, or final decisions, that can be done more effectively and efficiently in a synchronous manner. Those are often best facilitated by prior asynchronous communication, where everyone involved was able to consume and process the relevant information on their own time, and were able to take the time to dive as deep as needed in order to understand it sufficiently to make a sound decision. In many cases, I have seen that the act of taking time to write out your thoughts on an issue helps to crystallize and distill those thoughts. All of this leads to better thought and better decisions.</p>\n<p>That leads to my final point, which is that information needs to be recorded in a way that is easily findable. Often, this means in some kind of shared location that is organized well so that it is easily browsable and searchable. When conversations, or worse decisions, are scattered across many different mediums, or trapped in email or verbal conversations, we drastically reduce access to that information. This decision, whether made consciously or unconsciously, prevents transparency and excludes people. Those affected include current employees who are not involved, and especially all future employees. Making this wealth of knowledge and information available is another form of respect.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We will rarely have the opportunity that has been forced on us by this pandemic to re-evaluate the basic ways in which we operate and work together. It would be a tragedy if we did not leverage what we have seen and learned through this experience. One point that has been made repeatedly is that many parts of the company have actually become more productive during this time. I think it is easy for us to gloss over the significance of that fact. Our lives have been severely disrupted. The level of uncertainty we have all experienced is unprecedented in most of our lifetimes. We have not actually been working remotely—we have been surviving a crisis, and forced to cope in whatever way we can. For some people to have become more productive during this time speaks volumes to the potential of remote work, especially if it is approached thoughtfully and done deliberately. Not everyone will choose to work remotely, and I think it would be a mistake to force them to do so. It is not the best fit for everyone. But neither is colocated work. We should respect our people enough to be flexible and open to the way in which they can best work.</p>\n<p>To succeed in working remotely, our leaders will have to step up. One of the most beautiful examples of that throughout this pandemic is the daily emails coauthored by our C.E.O. and HR leader. I have heard from so many people who have been encouraged and uplifted and have felt more connected to each other and to the company through those message. In some ways, it is sad that it took a crisis like this for us to start reaching out to the whole company in that way. It also seems unfair to me that one or two people seem to have carried so much of that burden. My one wish is that those touching messages were not trapped inside email. How helpful and inspiring it would be to have all of those messages preserved somewhere like <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence\">Confluence</a> or <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/\">Basecamp</a> where everyone could still be notified of them, but have them archived and available for reference and future employees. (Note: I realized nothing was stopping me from doing exactly that, so I have copied and pasted the emails in a Confluence page).</p>\n<p>I strongly hope that we will take this opportunity to consider how best to work. I would love to be involved in exploring what that could look like, and thrilled to share my experience working remotely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"recommendation\">Recommendation</h3>\n<p>Based on all that we have seen, I suggest that we institute a policy of allowed work for designated departments. There are obviously some groups, such as Manufacturing, Security, Maintenance, and others who cannot work remotely. But for those groups who can, such as Client Success, Marketing, I.T., and others, I think we should just give everyone in those departments full permission to work remotely if they want. Individuals teams will naturally establish norms of communication and schedules of synchronous time, including in person if needed.

Read the introduction <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/13/thoughts-on-leadership.html\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>In this final article of my series on leadership, I want to tie everything together. So far, I have written about the <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/14/leading-through-trust.html\">importance of trust</a>, a leader’s role to <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/15/a-leaders-role.html\">protect</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/17/a-leaders-role.html\">provide</a> which both require high trust, and the <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/21/stages-of-leadership.html\">three stages of leadership</a>, the highest of which, servant leader, is the only that actually fulfills the roles completely. I want to conclude with the consequences of all of this.</p>\n<p>As I constantly try and help my seven young children understand, we are free to make our own choices, but we do not get to choose the consequences of those choices. Therefore, it is vitally important that we understand the natural results of different courses of action so that we have the ability to influence them.</p>\n<p>There are a number of different effects of leadership that we could consider in evaluating the impacts of the stages of leadership. As a quick review of <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/21/stages-of-leadership.html\">my last article</a>, those stages are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Cruel tyrant</strong>. Punishes bad behavior.</li>\n<li><strong>Benevolent dictator</strong>. Rewards good behavior.</li>\n<li><strong>Servant leader</strong>. Unblocks and trusts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I will explore just a few of the possible effects: <strong>team makeup</strong>, <strong>team perspective</strong>, and <strong>team health</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"team-makeup\">Team makeup</h2>\n<p>On a team that is led by a cruel tyrant, people are not focused on achieving together. They are just worried about their own necks. This type of leader creates a team comprised of <strong>scared, resentful individuals</strong>. The potential output of this team vastly exceeds their reality because most of their time and energy is being spent trying to ensure survival.</p>\n<p>With a benevolent dictator, the overall tenor improves. People on the team are not operating as much out of fear. This leader creates a team of <strong>happy, complacent individuals</strong>. They have been robbed of their intrinsic motivation for their work, and now respond mainly to external motivators—rewards. The quality of their work usually falls to whatever level is required in order to be recognized, or to stand above their peers. Much of their time and energy is spent seeking advantage over others.</p>\n<p>A servant leader creates a completely different kind of team. Instead of disparate individuals, a sense of <em>esprit de corps</em> prevails. This leader fosters a <strong>united, driven team</strong>. Because the efforts and energy of these people are dedicated to their common objective, much more is typically accomplished. Members of the team feel a sense of belonging to something bigger than themselves, and they are willing to make personal sacrifices to ensure the success of the group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"team-perspective\">Team perspective</h2>\n<h3 id=\"cruel-tyrant\">Cruel tyrant</h3>\n<p>A cruel tyrant views other people, especially those on their team, as <strong>disposable</strong>. The people themselves don’t matter—as long as they don’t create problems, they are largely ignored. In the parlance of <a href=\"https://arbinger.com/home.html\">Arbinger Institute</a>, these leaders see others as objects, and more specifically, as <strong>irrelevancies</strong>.</p>\n<p>This has a dramatic effect on the members of the teams led by cruel tyrant. Because they are living and working in fear, other people on the team or in the organization are <strong>enemies</strong>. Each one is a possible informant; someone watching for the slightest mistake in order to report and thus avoid personal punishment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"benevolent-dictator\">Benevolent dictator</h3>\n<p>Benevolent dictators have a similar, but slightly different view of others. The people still don’t matter, but the results do. Others are viewed as <strong>potential output</strong>. Again, in the <a href=\"https://arbinger.com/home.html\">Arbinger Institute</a> language, other people are objects, specifically <strong>vehicles</strong>. The leader may be nice, and even act caring, but all in the service of achieving the desired results.</p>\n<p>On teams with a benevolent dictator as the leader, people see each other as <strong>competitors</strong>. One person’s success means another person’s lost opportunity, so team members are constantly looking to one-up each other. They similarly see others as objects, in the <a href=\"https://arbinger.com/home.html\">Arbinger Institute</a> sense, but now as <strong>blockers</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"servant-leader\">Servant leader</h3>\n<p>With a servant leader, all of the insecurities are removed. This doesn’t mean those leaders and those teams are perfect. But they all see each other as <strong>people</strong>. No one matters more, or less, than anyone else. This allows them to work together in a united way to accomplish whatever outcomes they have prioritized. As mistakes arise, people are understanding and forgiving of others, even when those mistakes are a failure to be understanding and forgiving. This is not only a nicer environment in which to work, but also the most logical and rational approach to business, and to life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"team-health\">Team health</h2>\n<p>There are three areas in which the health of a team is affected by the leadership stage at work. If you think of the stages as a progression, these areas are all positively correlated, meaning that each increases with the stages. These are: <strong>psychological safety</strong>, <strong>conflict</strong>, and <strong>sustainability</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"psychological-safety\">Psychological safety</h3>\n<p>As the leader moves from the cruel tyrant to the benevolent dictator to the servant leader, the prevailing emotions change on a team. They go from <strong>fear and distrust</strong> to <strong>hope and greed</strong> to <strong>love and trust</strong>. As these emotions become more positive, the environment in which people live and work becomes safer. With that increase in safety, the emotional temperature changes. People are more free to speak their mind. Their thoughts are seen as valuable, and considered without prejudice. Creativity flows more naturally because the mental energy the team is expending focuses on the work instead of personal protection.</p>\n<p>All of us face challenges and stresses to our mental health. When work is a place of high stress, we become less able to cope with the normal ups and downs of life. But when our professional life is rewarding as well as safe, we can develop greater reserves with which to meet the challenges that we will inevitably face.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conflict\">Conflict</h3>\n<p>Some people are surprised to learn that healthier teams often fight more. Now, the word “fight” may not be the perfect term to capture exactly what is happening, but it is often how the situation looks to anyone on the outside. Having a healthier environment means that there is more opportunity for differing opinions to be shared and discussed productively. In my experience, people often get extremely passionate about the projects they are building, and the way in which they are built. Some of the best, and most productive conversations I have been part of were scarcely indistinguishable from heated arguments. The key is that the passion and emotion is directed at solving problems together, and not directed in animosity at other people.</p>\n<p>This kind of conflict that exists on healthy team is sometimes hard to distinguish from a toxic environment. But there is a huge difference. It does not necessarily mean that members of the team want to hang out together outside of work hours. One of the key indicators is the level of respect that people have for each other. When respect is high, people are more able to bring all of themselves to a situation or a problem, and feel free to point out shortcomings that they see in the solutions being discussed.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons that I bring this up and feel so strongly about it is that I have seen many leaders become so conflict-averse that they quell any disagreement out of fear that it could lead to an argument. Whether these leaders realize it or not, they are acting as dictators or even tyrants. They need to be more comfortable themselves with the knowledge that they will not always have the best ideas or solutions, and that the only way to maximize the ability of their team is to foster everyone contributing as much as they are able.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sustainability\">Sustainability</h3>\n<p>I want to make one final point that feels intuitive to many of us, but also has a strong business or financial component. When people feel comfortable and respected, they are likely to do more and to do it better. They are also likely to want to keep doing it. These are the teams that are the longest lasting, as well as being the most productive.</p>\n<p>As leaders, we are often seeking ways to unblock our teams, or to enable greater efficiency and greater productivity. The simplest answer is sometimes the easiest to overlook. The best thing we can do is not to set up extra programs or incentives or gamify work. Instead it is to become genuinely interested in the people that we lead and find ways to help them flourish and grow. Our job is to create an environment in which people can truly thrive, and then work carefully to maintain and enhance that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>When I wrote my series on <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/18/what-mental-illness.html\">what mental illness feels like</a> last year, I <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/27/i-finished-my.html\">commented</a> that it was my best writing so far.

They are just worried about their own necks. This type of leader creates a team comprised of **scared, resentful individuals**. The potential output of this team vastly exceeds their reality because most of their time and energy is being spent trying to ensure survival.\n\nWith a benevolent dictator, the overall tenor improves.

The quality of their work usually falls to whatever level is required in order to be recognized, or to stand above their peers. Much of their time and energy is spent seeking advantage over others.\n\nA servant leader creates a completely different kind of team. Instead of disparate individuals, a sense of *esprit de corps* prevails. This leader fosters a **united, driven team**. Because the efforts and energy of these people are dedicated to their common objective, much more is typically accomplished. Members of the team feel a sense of belonging to something bigger than themselves, and they are willing to make personal sacrifices to ensure the success of the group.\n\n\n## Team perspective\n\n### Cruel tyrant\n\nA cruel tyrant views other people, especially those on their team, as **disposable**. The people themselves don’t matter—as long as they don’t create problems, they are largely ignored. In the parlance of [Arbinger Institute](https://arbinger.com/home.html), these leaders see others as objects, and more specifically, as **irrelevancies**.\n\nThis has a dramatic effect on the members of the teams led by cruel tyrant. Because they are living and working in fear, other people on the team or in the organization are **enemies**. Each one is a possible informant; someone watching for the slightest mistake in order to report and thus avoid personal punishment.\n\n\n### Benevolent dictator\n\nBenevolent dictators have a similar, but slightly different view of others. The people still don’t matter, but the results do. Others are viewed as **potential output**. Again, in the [Arbinger Institute](https://arbinger.com/home.html) language, other people are objects, specifically **vehicles**. The leader may be nice, and even act caring, but all in the service of achieving the desired results.\n\nOn teams with a benevolent dictator as the leader, people see each other as **competitors**. One person’s success means another person’s lost opportunity, so team members are constantly looking to one-up each other. They similarly see others as objects, in the [Arbinger Institute](https://arbinger.com/home.html) sense, but now as **blockers**.\n\n\n### Servant leader\n\nWith a servant leader, all of the insecurities are removed. This doesn’t mean those leaders and those teams are perfect. But they all see each other as **people**. No one matters more, or less, than anyone else. This allows them to work together in a united way to accomplish whatever outcomes they have prioritized. As mistakes arise, people are understanding and forgiving of others, even when those mistakes are a failure to be understanding and forgiving.

They resort to threats or wield positional authority to ensure that all of their demands are met. They focus not on people, but on the behavior of those people, and try to shape it into what they want to happen.</p>\n<p>This first stage that many leaders go through is almost all based on fear. The leader both feels and inspires fear. They may be afraid of the responsibility and feel inadequate. That fear can manifest through an attempt to control the output of the team and even the individuals themselves.</p>\n<p>In many ways, this fear is understandable. Often, a new leader is promoted because of excellence as an individual contributor. But now they are no longer responsible for performing great work, they are responsible for ensuring that others perform great work. They may see that what they are measured on is results, and so they focus completely on results. They might not know how to motivate or inspire others to achieve those results, and so they fall back on the only thing they know.</p>\n<p>This leader often insists on people working in a certain way, at a certain location, during certain hours because without this certainty, they feel helpless and out of control. They create a culture of mistrust and breed resentment among individuals. They rule with an iron fist and demand compliance. They may feel that people respect them, but in reality they are merely feared.</p>\n<p>Most of us know what it is like to work with a leader in this stage, and find the experience demoralizing, demotivating, and dehumanizing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benevolent-dictator\">Benevolent dictator</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2020/cd63b96ebe.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"c34e41706cc86110e6aa9de1f197acbf\"\n   \n>\n  <img src =\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2020/cd63b96ebe.jpg\" \n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"Benevolent dictator\" \n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</p>\n<p>The mark of a benevolent dictator is that they try to influence others by <strong>rewarding good behavior</strong>. Again, they focus not on people, but rather their actions and try to shape them into something more desirable. They seem to be offering a lollipop, but in fact hide the sword that is implied in failing to measure up.</p>\n<p>This next stage that most leaders go through is really just a more positive twist on the same theme as the cruel tyrant. In this stage, the leader is still focused on behavior and results, but seeks to influence others through reward instead of punishment. Because this leader is using rewards, they often think that they are a more positive leader and having a better impact on others. This is probably true—behavior is modified better through positive rather than negative consequences.</p>\n<p>But there are still many problems with this approach to leadership. Treating people as if they are only as important as the results they provide is demeaning and leads to objectification. Those who are led in this way begin to spend their time and energy finding ways to get ahead or to get credit for positive results. Whereas with a cruel tyrant, people tend to just look out for themselves and try to not stick out or be noticed, a benevolent dictator encourages people to put others down in an effort to raise themselves up.</p>\n<p>Motivation plummets when people are led in this way. Instead of allowing intrinsic desire and satisfaction to drive someone to excel, work is turned into a transaction.

They see others as people, and take the time to get to know them and understand their strengths and limitations, and work to shape the environment to foster success. Only when operating this way can a leader truly perform their role to <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/15/a-leaders-role.html\">protect</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/17/a-leaders-role.html\">provide</a>.</p>\n<p>This final stage is one of the most elusive.

I want to explore this further by considering how a leader can provide <strong>support</strong>, <strong>clarity</strong>, and <strong>results</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Note: This is part of a series sharing my thoughts on leadership. Read the introduction <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/13/thoughts-on-leadership.html\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>In my last installment of my series on leadership, I explored the <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/15/a-leaders-role.html\">role of a leader to <strong>protect</strong></a>. In my opinion, this comprises half of what a leader must do in order to be successful, with the other half being to <strong>provide</strong>. This may be an oversimplification, but it has been helpful for me to think about leadership in simpler terms so that I can better understand how to work to improve.</p>\n<p>Again, these thoughts are set to the backdrop of my favorite definition of leadership by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nielnickolaisen\">Niel Nickolaisen</a>, our CIO at O.C. Tanner:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A leader is someone others choose to follow</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"provide\">Provide</h2>\n<p>Another archetypal leader that comes to mind for me is a kind of trail guide. I picture someone who has experience with the terrain, knows how to prepare for success, and is out in front of a group, showing them the way. The guide leads the group through crowded forests, up mountain passes, past precarious cliffs to an end destination that is fulfilling and rewarding for all. Along the way, the guide gives encouragement, performs first aid, assists in gathering nourishment, and ultimately is responsible for the group arriving safely.</p>\n<p>In business, and in life, the role of a leader is similar, although perhaps less rugged at times. There are many ways that a leader can provide, and I will focus on these three:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support</li>\n<li>Clarity</li>\n<li>Results</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When I originally thought of these principles, I paired them together with those from the <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/15/a-leaders-role.html\">role to <strong>protect</strong></a>. So, a leader will protect individuals and provide them support. A leader will protect the team and provide them clarity. And a leader will protect the company and provide it results. After thinking about these more, I have realized that all of the concepts are more intertwined.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support\">Support</h3>\n<p>One of the first things that a leader must provide is support. Thinking first of providing support to individuals, a leader can do that through <strong>scheduled time</strong>. If the leader is also the reporting manager for an individual, that scheduled time should take the form of a regular one-to-one meeting. It is the leader’s responsibility to carve out that time, but the time belongs to the individual. This should be a time where the leader can learn how more about the individual and how to better support them. These meetings work best when regularly scheduled in advance, and when both participants can contribute to the agenda beforehand.</p>\n<p>For those situations when the leader is not the direct manager of an individual, having scheduled time might look a little different. It could still take the form of one-to-one meetings, but it could also look like regular time to review work or to ask questions. The key is that the individual knows that they have your attention for a certain time, preferably undivided.</p>\n<p>This can feel both overwhelming and comforting at the same time. It can be overwhelming if you are a leader responsible for many people. You may be wondering how you will ever find the time to devote to each person individually. As a father of seven children, I am familiar with this particular form of overwhelm.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there is comfort in the fact that scheduling time for your people doesn’t require any special skills. You don’t actually have to be the best listener, or the most personable, or any superlative at all. You just have to be willing to put in the effort to show that you care. Just by scheduling the time, and muddling through as best as you can, you are clearly communicating to your people that they are valuable to you—valuable enough to displace other things that you could be doing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clarity\">Clarity</h3>\n<p>Clarity strikes me as a concept for which we all naturally yearn. As the <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/29.18?lang=eng&amp;clang=eng#p17\">book of Proverbs says</a>, “Where there is no vision, the people perish.” I have learned, through my experiences with mental illness, that uncertainty is a major trigger for many people. It gets exaggerated in those who struggle with some form of mental illness, but it affects all of us. A leader can do a great deal to instill calm and assurance that we can deal with the uncertainty that must exist, while simultaneously removing whatever is unnecessary.</p>\n<p>For a team in particular, one of the greatest ways that a leader can provide clarity is through <strong>defined work</strong>. When a team can come together around a shared mission that they all understand and can see a path to accomplish, or at least to begin, something magical seems to happen. No longer are people spending mental energy grappling with the unknown—instead they are able to apply themselves completely to implementing the vision. People are more engaged and excited to come to work. As a software engineer, the lack of defined work is perhaps one of the largest factors I have seen in people leaving an organization.</p>\n<p>This clarity can come to individuals in ways that unlock their potential as well. When someone knows exactly what is expected of them, and is empowered to take steps to fulfill those expectations, they often thrive and excel. When we don’t really know what success looks like, the situation can become demoralizing because we never know if we are making progress, treading water, or backsliding.</p>\n<p>Companies also benefit from a leader who is able to provide clarity. Sometimes, the greatest service one can do is to say no to the right things at the right time. If a leader can be clear on what is included in a particular endeavor, and what needs to wait for the future, a company can relax and trust that things are going to work out. Of course, this requires the leader to provide the final piece as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"results\">Results</h3>\n<p>A leader is most often judged on what the people they lead can deliver. As an individual contributor, you are evaluated based on your personal results, but as a leader, you are responsible for the results of others. This can be disorientating and intimidating to new leaders. Earlier in my career, I found the lack of personal delivery a challenge in my creative fulfillment. Over time, I found greater joy and satisfaction in seeking to unlock others in their potential, and to see what we can accomplish as a group.</p>\n<p>One of the best tools that a leader has to influence the results that are delivered is <strong>process</strong>. This can be an unglamorous view, but it is the simple, almost unseen structures that a leader puts into place that can truly facilitate people’s achievement. As a leader becomes more comfortable with process, and understands better how to shape and mold it in such a way to empower and unblock others, that leader becomes capable of more influence than ever.</p>\n<p>One of the ways in which process can influence the delivery of results is through the safety and stability that it can provide. As humans, we are not thrown by difficult circumstances nearly as much as we by unanticipated circumstances. If we have a plan to attack an obstacle, then it becomes an opportunity rather than a hinderance.</p>\n<p>As we as leaders come to embrace our role in honing and tweaking the process, we become invaluable to our organizations for our ability to influence and drive results. Our team and others can look to us for guidance on how to approach a given situation, and we can find the small points of friction that slow a team down and adjust to make improvements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p><strong>Protecting</strong> and <strong>providing</strong> work seamlessly together to enable us as leaders to perform all of our necessary functions better. As we provide results, we are better able to protect our team, our people, and our company. We can serve as a beacon to follow as well as a shield to defend our people from distraction or outside pressure. Leadership is more important than ever, and I hope that it is helpful for you as it has been for me to distill the role of a leader down to simple terms.</p>\n<p><em>In the next article in my <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/13/thoughts-on-leadership.html\">series on leadership</a>, I will be exploring the three stages of leadership.</em></p>",

Read the introduction [here](https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/13/thoughts-on-leadership.html).*\n\n***\n\nIn my last installment of my series on leadership, I explored the [role of a leader to **protect**](https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/15/a-leaders-role.html). In my opinion, this comprises half of what a leader must do in order to be successful, with the other half being to **provide**. This may be an oversimplification, but it has been helpful for me to think about leadership in simpler terms so that I can better understand how to work to improve.\n\nAgain, these thoughts are set to the backdrop of my favorite definition of leadership by [Niel Nickolaisen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nielnickolaisen), our CIO at O.C. Tanner:\n\n> A leader is someone others choose to follow\n\n## Provide\n\nAnother archetypal leader that comes to mind for me is a kind of trail guide. I picture someone who has experience with the terrain, knows how to prepare for success, and is out in front of a group, showing them the way. The guide leads the group through crowded forests, up mountain passes, past precarious cliffs to an end destination that is fulfilling and rewarding for all. Along the way, the guide gives encouragement, performs first aid, assists in gathering nourishment, and ultimately is responsible for the group arriving safely.\n\nIn business, and in life, the role of a leader is similar, although perhaps less rugged at times. There are many ways that a leader can provide, and I will focus on these three:\n\n- Support\n- Clarity\n- Results\n\nWhen I originally thought of these principles, I paired them together with those from the [role to **protect**](https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/15/a-leaders-role.html). So, a leader will protect individuals and provide them support. A leader will protect the team and provide them clarity. And a leader will protect the company and provide it results. After thinking about these more, I have realized that all of the concepts are more intertwined.\n\n### Support\n\nOne of the first things that a leader must provide is support. Thinking first of providing support to individuals, a leader can do that through **scheduled time**. If the leader is also the reporting manager for an individual, that scheduled time should take the form of a regular one-to-one meeting. It is the leader’s responsibility to carve out that time, but the time belongs to the individual. This should be a time where the leader can learn how more about the individual and how to better support them. These meetings work best when regularly scheduled in advance, and when both participants can contribute to the agenda beforehand.\n\nFor those situations when the leader is not the direct manager of an individual, having scheduled time might look a little different. It could still take the form of one-to-one meetings, but it could also look like regular time to review work or to ask questions. The key is that the individual knows that they have your attention for a certain time, preferably undivided.\n\nThis can feel both overwhelming and comforting at the same time. It can be overwhelming if you are a leader responsible for many people. You may be wondering how you will ever find the time to devote to each person individually. As a father of seven children, I am familiar with this particular form of overwhelm.\n\nOn the other hand, there is comfort in the fact that scheduling time for your people doesn’t require any special skills. You don’t actually have to be the best listener, or the most personable, or any superlative at all. You just have to be willing to put in the effort to show that you care. Just by scheduling the time, and muddling through as best as you can, you are clearly communicating to your people that they are valuable to you—valuable enough to displace other things that you could be doing.\n\n\n### Clarity\n\nClarity strikes me as a concept for which we all naturally yearn. As the [book of Proverbs says](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/29.18?lang=eng&clang=eng#p17), “Where there is no vision, the people perish.” I have learned, through my experiences with mental illness, that uncertainty is a major trigger for many people. It gets exaggerated in those who struggle with some form of mental illness, but it affects all of us. A leader can do a great deal to instill calm and assurance that we can deal with the uncertainty that must exist, while simultaneously removing whatever is unnecessary.\n\nFor a team in particular, one of the greatest ways that a leader can provide clarity is through **defined work**. When a team can come together around a shared mission that they all understand and can see a path to accomplish, or at least to begin, something magical seems to happen. No longer are people spending mental energy grappling with the unknown—instead they are able to apply themselves completely to implementing the vision. People are more engaged and excited to come to work. As a software engineer, the lack of defined work is perhaps one of the largest factors I have seen in people leaving an organization.\n\nThis clarity can come to individuals in ways that unlock their potential as well. When someone knows exactly what is expected of them, and is empowered to take steps to fulfill those expectations, they often thrive and excel. When we don’t really know what success looks like, the situation can become demoralizing because we never know if we are making progress, treading water, or backsliding.\n\nCompanies also benefit from a leader who is able to provide clarity. Sometimes, the greatest service one can do is to say no to the right things at the right time. If a leader can be clear on what is included in a particular endeavor, and what needs to wait for the future, a company can relax and trust that things are going to work out. Of course, this requires the leader to provide the final piece as well.\n\n\n### Results\n\nA leader is most often judged on what the people they lead can deliver. As an individual contributor, you are evaluated based on your personal results, but as a leader, you are responsible for the results of others. This can be disorientating and intimidating to new leaders. Earlier in my career, I found the lack of personal delivery a challenge in my creative fulfillment. Over time, I found greater joy and satisfaction in seeking to unlock others in their potential, and to see what we can accomplish as a group.\n\nOne of the best tools that a leader has to influence the results that are delivered is **process**. This can be an unglamorous view, but it is the simple, almost unseen structures that a leader puts into place that can truly facilitate people’s achievement. As a leader becomes more comfortable with process, and understands better how to shape and mold it in such a way to empower and unblock others, that leader becomes capable of more influence than ever.\n\nOne of the ways in which process can influence the delivery of results is through the safety and stability that it can provide. As humans, we are not thrown by difficult circumstances nearly as much as we by unanticipated circumstances. If we have a plan to attack an obstacle, then it becomes an opportunity rather than a hinderance.\n\nAs we as leaders come to embrace our role in honing and tweaking the process, we become invaluable to our organizations for our ability to influence and drive results. Our team and others can look to us for guidance on how to approach a given situation, and we can find the small points of friction that slow a team down and adjust to make improvements.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Protecting** and **providing** work seamlessly together to enable us as leaders to perform all of our necessary functions better. As we provide results, we are better able to protect our team, our people, and our company. We can serve as a beacon to follow as well as a shield to defend our people from distraction or outside pressure. Leadership is more important than ever, and I hope that it is helpful for you as it has been for me to distill the role of a leader down to simple terms.\n\n_In the next article in my [series on leadership](https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/13/thoughts-on-leadership.html), I will be exploring the three stages of leadership._\n",

As I thought and thought about leadership, I decided that the most important aspect is <strong>trust</strong>. I want to explore how I landed on that, and what the implications are.</p>\n<h2 id=\"leadership-and-following\">Leadership and following</h2>\n<p>In order to simplify leadership down to a single idea, we must first describe what we mean by leadership. My favorite definition comes from <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nielnickolaisen\">Niel Nickolaisen</a>, our CIO at O.C. Tanner:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A leader is someone others choose to follow</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When we consider whom to follow, there are logical and also emotional reasons at play. Logically, we seek assurance that choosing to follow someone will lead to positive outcomes. Emotionally, if we fear that our choice might cause us harm or bring great uncertainty, we are unlikely to pursue that option.</p>\n<p>As we seek to become a leader, we have to realize that every action we take either increases trust in us or erodes it. When we cause uncertainty, those who might follow us will lose trust and will choose someone else. As trust wanes in us as a leader, we can only lead through positional authority. The only people following us then are those forced.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trusting-others\">Trusting others</h2>\n<p>One of the simplest ways to earn trust is by demonstrating it in others. Too often, when we are placed in leadership roles in the workplace, we become insecure in ourselves and our ability to lead and influence others. We recognize that a result of good leadership is good output from those who report to us, and we narrowly focus on the end while ignoring the means. Ironically, this often drives us to micromanage or even redo work done by others in our quest for perfect results. This kind of behavior on our part may deliver short-term improvements, but as we overly control our people, we undermine our future success.</p>\n<p>It is worth considering the different ways we can show trust or a lack of it to those we seek to lead. We may think that we trust our people, and not even realize that our actions communicate the opposite.</p>\n<p>In a professional setting, one of the most common ways that leaders demonstrate a lack of trust is by requiring that work is done in a certain way. This may look like excessive check-ins, or stringent guidelines that spell out exactly how something must be accomplished. Naturally, there are times when exactitude is required, but most of the time, we can provide clear guidance of the outcomes that are desired, and leave up to those who will implement to determine the outputs necessary to achieve those outcomes.</p>\n<p>Another common form of communicating a lack of trust is requiring that work happen in a specific location at specific hours. It is true that some activities are best performed in a face-to-face synchronous form. However, many professional activities, particularly those performed by an individual contributor, can be accomplished anywhere and at anytime. When we require that all work happen in the office during designated work hours, we effective communicate to our people that the time they are at their desk matters more than the work they do. We don’t trust them to get done what is needed in the right way, and so we have to monitor them constantly.</p>\n<p>Trusting others is the right thing to do. In this way we honor the humanity of others and their right to learn and grow. They matter like we matter. Trusting them, and communicating that trust, is crucial to our development as leaders. This is also one of the best ways to develop the trust of others.</p>\n<h2 id=\"building-trust\">Building trust</h2>\n<p>In addition to trusting others, there are a couple other key things we can do to help foster others’ trust in us: <strong>competence</strong> and <strong>care</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"competence\">Competence</h3>\n<p>Most people yearn to follow someone who actually knows what they are doing and is good at it. As we develop competence as a leader, we become that person others choose to follow. In future articles, I will explore in more detail what competence as a leader looks like. For now, it is enough to say that focusing on improving in our job is a great way to help instill confidence in others that we are likely to succeed as a leader and help them succeed as they follow us.</p>\n<h3 id=\"care\">Care</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are many brilliant jerks in the world, and especially in the workplace. These are people who may be extremely hard-working and competent, but have a negative influence on people around them. They care much more about results than they do about people, and this ironically often leads to poorer results in the end.</p>\n<p>A good leader builds trust by genuinely caring about other people. When we encounter someone who is skilled and competent, and also who clearly sees us as a person who matters like they do, we are much more likely to have confidence in what they might tell us. Our fears of ulterior motives dissipate, and we can trust that they are not putting their own interests above ours. This frees us up to follow without reserve and to accept direct, even harsh feedback at times, which can help us improve at an exponential rate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Trust is the most precious coin a leader possesses. It must be careful cultivated and consciously spent. Almost every action contributes to an increase or a decrease in the trust others have in us. This makes the biggest difference in whether people will choose to follow us, or will reluctantly do what we ask out of obligation.</p>\n<p><em>In the next article in my <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/13/thoughts-on-leadership.html\">series on leadership</a>, I will explore the <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/15/a-leaders-role.html\">role of a leader</a>.</em></p>",

I want to explore how I landed on that, and what the implications are.\n\n\n## Leadership and following\n\nIn order to simplify leadership down to a single idea, we must first describe what we mean by leadership. My favorite definition comes from [Niel Nickolaisen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nielnickolaisen), our CIO at O.C. Tanner:\n\n> A leader is someone others choose to follow\n\nWhen we consider whom to follow, there are logical and also emotional reasons at play. Logically, we seek assurance that choosing to follow someone will lead to positive outcomes. Emotionally, if we fear that our choice might cause us harm or bring great uncertainty, we are unlikely to pursue that option.\n\nAs we seek to become a leader, we have to realize that every action we take either increases trust in us or erodes it. When we cause uncertainty, those who might follow us will lose trust and will choose someone else. As trust wanes in us as a leader, we can only lead through positional authority. The only people following us then are those forced.\n\n\n## Trusting others\n\nOne of the simplest ways to earn trust is by demonstrating it in others. Too often, when we are placed in leadership roles in the workplace, we become insecure in ourselves and our ability to lead and influence others. We recognize that a result of good leadership is good output from those who report to us, and we narrowly focus on the end while ignoring the means. Ironically, this often drives us to micromanage or even redo work done by others in our quest for perfect results. This kind of behavior on our part may deliver short-term improvements, but as we overly control our people, we undermine our future success.\n\nIt is worth considering the different ways we can show trust or a lack of it to those we seek to lead. We may think that we trust our people, and not even realize that our actions communicate the opposite.\n\nIn a professional setting, one of the most common ways that leaders demonstrate a lack of trust is by requiring that work is done in a certain way. This may look like excessive check-ins, or stringent guidelines that spell out exactly how something must be accomplished. Naturally, there are times when exactitude is required, but most of the time, we can provide clear guidance of the outcomes that are desired, and leave up to those who will implement to determine the outputs necessary to achieve those outcomes.\n\nAnother common form of communicating a lack of trust is requiring that work happen in a specific location at specific hours. It is true that some activities are best performed in a face-to-face synchronous form. However, many professional activities, particularly those performed by an individual contributor, can be accomplished anywhere and at anytime. When we require that all work happen in the office during designated work hours, we effective communicate to our people that the time they are at their desk matters more than the work they do. We don’t trust them to get done what is needed in the right way, and so we have to monitor them constantly.\n\nTrusting others is the right thing to do. In this way we honor the humanity of others and their right to learn and grow. They matter like we matter. Trusting them, and communicating that trust, is crucial to our development as leaders. This is also one of the best ways to develop the trust of others.\n\n\n## Building trust\n\nIn addition to trusting others, there are a couple other key things we can do to help foster others’ trust in us: **competence** and **care**.\n\n\n### Competence\n\nMost people yearn to follow someone who actually knows what they are doing and is good at it. As we develop competence as a leader, we become that person others choose to follow. In future articles, I will explore in more detail what competence as a leader looks like. For now, it is enough to say that focusing on improving in our job is a great way to help instill confidence in others that we are likely to succeed as a leader and help them succeed as they follow us.\n\n\n### Care\n\nUnfortunately, there are many brilliant jerks in the world, and especially in the workplace. These are people who may be extremely hard-working and competent, but have a negative influence on people around them. They care much more about results than they do about people, and this ironically often leads to poorer results in the end.\n\nA good leader builds trust by genuinely caring about other people. When we encounter someone who is skilled and competent, and also who clearly sees us as a person who matters like they do, we are much more likely to have confidence in what they might tell us. Our fears of ulterior motives dissipate, and we can trust that they are not putting their own interests above ours. This frees us up to follow without reserve and to accept direct, even harsh feedback at times, which can help us improve at an exponential rate.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTrust is the most precious coin a leader possesses. It must be careful cultivated and consciously spent. Almost every action contributes to an increase or a decrease in the trust others have in us. This makes the biggest difference in whether people will choose to follow us, or will reluctantly do what we ask out of obligation.\n\n_In the next article in my [series on leadership](https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/13/thoughts-on-leadership.html), I will explore the [role of a leader](https://www.bennorris.org/2020/04/15/a-leaders-role.html)._\n",

It appears when I touch the trackpad, and disappears when I type or touch the screen. Hovering over buttons or apps is intuitive and delightful. I never wonder where the cursor went or what is happening. As Craig Mod said,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And yet somehow, the overall effect of using a trackpad with an iPad is more convincing than direct manipulation, less exhausting, and simply more <em>fun</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I look forward to using the newest Magic Keyboard in a few months. Until then, I will happily use my iPad with a trackpad sitting next to it.</p>",

I remember last summer when [mouse support was announced as an accessibility feature](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647071/apple-ipad-os-mouse-support-wwdc-2019). At the time, I dismissed it as something that I wouldn’t really need or use. When I saw the new demo video, my interest was piqued, and I gave it a try.\n\nAll of my doubt was swept away in an instant. In a way that I never expected, the cursor feels right at home. It appears when I touch the trackpad, and disappears when I type or touch the screen. Hovering over buttons or apps is intuitive and delightful. I never wonder where the cursor went or what is happening. As Craig Mod said,\n\n> And yet somehow, the overall effect of using a trackpad with an iPad is more convincing than direct manipulation, less exhausting, and simply more *fun*.\n\nI look forward to using the newest Magic Keyboard in a few months. Until then, I will happily use my iPad with a trackpad sitting next to it.\n",

I’ve been thinking that the phone background that I want is a nicely designed sign that says, “Here we make mistakes” so that I can carry that with me all the time.</p>\n<p>As I started pondering this question, the other thing that stood out to me is to carry less. I have a tendency to carry the emotional burdens of others, and as an empath, I feel those keenly as well. Especially since I am hoping to start talking more about mental health at work, I think it is crucial that I learn how to connect with someone in their pain and not take it with me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Having decided on those two goals, I started sketching some wallpapers. As I did that, I thought more about the second goal and what the purpose is. I realized that the key is that I want to be able to direct my emotional energy to my highest priorities.

And because of my OCD, I tend to ruminate on the issue, and it weighs heavily on me.</p>\n<p>With that realization, I had my three goals. There is nothing magical about having three, but there is a nice symmetry to it. In many ways, they are pretty focused on my home life with my family. I want to work to make our home a safe place to make mistakes and learn together. And then I want to make sure that I reserve enough energy to devote to my family. Too often, I will come home from work exhausted because something happened that drained me. I want to fully engage at work, but not at the expense of being able to engage at home.</p>\n<p>I decided this year to split up the goals between the lock screen and the home screen. As I go to turn on my phone, I will remember each time that I want to make more mistakes and become more comfortable with that.

Going into this year, I made further adjustments. I have the apps Calm, Things, iA Writer, and Day One now in my dock.

				"title": "💮 Balancing realities",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>A central tenet of dialectical behavioral therapy became my reality recently; I was able to embrace two apparently contradictory realities.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The first weekend of April was <a href=\"https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/april-2019-general-conference-news-summary\">General Conference</a> in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is essentially ten hours of sermons spread over five different two-hour sessions. That has always been a weekend that I have anticipated and enjoyed. It occurs every April and October, and so this was the first conference since I learned that I have OCD. Last October, I was still in the discovery phase, and did not know what I was dealing with.</p>\n<p>A big part of my diagnosis is dealing with black-and-white thinking. I struggle to see a spectrum, and view the world through binary glasses. As I mentioned in my <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/26/coming-out.html\">coming out story</a>, my family and religious culture growing up fed in to my black-and-thinking, and reinforced my notion of decisions being moral and absolute. I was always following either Satan or the Savior. This is something I have discussed at length with my therapist, who is of my same faith. When I complained to her about the reinforcement that I felt I received, she told me that most people who heard the same thing did not feel the same distress, and instead found it helpful to guide them as they made moral choices. The problem is not the emphasis on righteous choices, but the fact that OCD twists those teachings to mean something different to my mind.</p>\n<p>Even with all of that context and preparation, I was taken off-guard with how challenging it was for me to listen to the conference talks. They are addressed to a diverse worldwide audience. I had not realized that I was having a hard time until my sister messaged me Saturday evening and asked how I was doing. When I paused to consider, I found that I was feeling overwhelmed. My sister asked if I was overwhelmed from conference or from normal family chaos. Again, I had to stop to think and found that it was a bit of both. There were a few talks that were especially challenging for me. I left things there that night and did not think about it much.</p>\n<p>The next morning, I asked a couple of my kids which talk was their favorite from the previous day. I had a learning moment when my son shared that his favorite talk was precisely the one that I found the most challenging. It was a great reminder to me that most people are not going to hear the same difficult messages that I do, and will instead find hope and encouragement. Before the sessions started up again, I took a few minutes to write in my journal to process my feelings. I wanted to share an epiphany that I had.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I wanted to take a minute and try to shine some light on and reveal exactly what it was that was so hard for me yesterday. The talk that struck me as painful reinforced some of my black and white thinking around right and wrong. It seemed to say to me that I was not doing enough, or well enough, and need to be better. The thing is — that is true. I do need to do better. But I need to allow two seemingly contradictory thoughts to co-exist in my mind. I am good enough, and valuable just as I am today and I need to be and do better. In many ways, President Nelson’s talk about the importance of repentance could have been hard for me but wasn’t. Somehow, I was able to feel both feelings at the same time. I am lovable and loved right now, and I also need to and can improve and become more like Christ.</p>\n<p>That dichotomy is from God. Feeling either of those feelings alone without the balancing effect of the other is not what God wants me to feel. That is <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/26/what-intrusive-thoughts.html\">Fernando</a>, or even Satan himself, wants for me. The more I get to know Fernando, and how his voice sounds and feels, the more easily I will be able to detect his lopsided arguments.

				"content_text": "<img src=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/0c722b06c1.png\" alt=\"Opposing thoughts\" />\n\nA central tenet of dialectical behavioral therapy became my reality recently; I was able to embrace two apparently contradictory realities.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n***\n\nThe first weekend of April was [General Conference](https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/april-2019-general-conference-news-summary) in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is essentially ten hours of sermons spread over five different two-hour sessions. That has always been a weekend that I have anticipated and enjoyed. It occurs every April and October, and so this was the first conference since I learned that I have OCD. Last October, I was still in the discovery phase, and did not know what I was dealing with.\n\nA big part of my diagnosis is dealing with black-and-white thinking. I struggle to see a spectrum, and view the world through binary glasses. As I mentioned in my [coming out story](https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/26/coming-out.html), my family and religious culture growing up fed in to my black-and-thinking, and reinforced my notion of decisions being moral and absolute. I was always following either Satan or the Savior. This is something I have discussed at length with my therapist, who is of my same faith. When I complained to her about the reinforcement that I felt I received, she told me that most people who heard the same thing did not feel the same distress, and instead found it helpful to guide them as they made moral choices. The problem is not the emphasis on righteous choices, but the fact that OCD twists those teachings to mean something different to my mind.\n\nEven with all of that context and preparation, I was taken off-guard with how challenging it was for me to listen to the conference talks. They are addressed to a diverse worldwide audience. I had not realized that I was having a hard time until my sister messaged me Saturday evening and asked how I was doing. When I paused to consider, I found that I was feeling overwhelmed. My sister asked if I was overwhelmed from conference or from normal family chaos. Again, I had to stop to think and found that it was a bit of both. There were a few talks that were especially challenging for me. I left things there that night and did not think about it much.\n\nThe next morning, I asked a couple of my kids which talk was their favorite from the previous day. I had a learning moment when my son shared that his favorite talk was precisely the one that I found the most challenging. It was a great reminder to me that most people are not going to hear the same difficult messages that I do, and will instead find hope and encouragement. Before the sessions started up again, I took a few minutes to write in my journal to process my feelings. I wanted to share an epiphany that I had.\n\n> I wanted to take a minute and try to shine some light on and reveal exactly what it was that was so hard for me yesterday. The talk that struck me as painful reinforced some of my black and white thinking around right and wrong. It seemed to say to me that I was not doing enough, or well enough, and need to be better. The thing is — that is true. I do need to do better. But I need to allow two seemingly contradictory thoughts to co-exist in my mind. I am good enough, and valuable just as I am today and I need to be and do better. In many ways, President Nelson’s talk about the importance of repentance could have been hard for me but wasn’t. Somehow, I was able to feel both feelings at the same time. I am lovable and loved right now, and I also need to and can improve and become more like Christ.\n> \n> That dichotomy is from God. Feeling either of those feelings alone without the balancing effect of the other is not what God wants me to feel. That is [Fernando](https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/26/what-intrusive-thoughts.html), or even Satan himself, wants for me. The more I get to know Fernando, and how his voice sounds and feels, the more easily I will be able to detect his lopsided arguments. It is not that what he says is always untrue — it is just incomplete. God has more for me.\n\nI felt an overwhelming sensation of peace and comfort as I wrote those words. I knew that God did not want me to feel shame and despair, but rather hope and encouragement. I was surprised when a talk was hard for me again later on Sunday. I thought to myself, “I already processed this, and it shouldn’t be hard anymore.” It was a good reminder that this is an ongoing process, and highly uncertain.\n\nI know now that this realization does not guarantee that I will never struggle again. I will continue to see the world in black and white, and will need to pause and confront the distortions. Even more importantly, I need to cultivate the skill of holding two opposite truths and allowing them to co-exist in my mind. Life is messy, and usually non-binary. That is a struggle for me, but I am coming to accept it.\n",

I was tired of the struggle and the burden I felt I was on everyone else, especially my wife. Monday, January 14, I went to work with an overnight bag. I left work in the afternoon and drove to the nearest hospital with a psych ward, called my wife to let her know what I was doing, and then admitted myself for the night. The psychiatrist asked if I would be safe if I went home, and I replied that I would because my wife was there, but I was done putting it all on her, and I did not feel safe being on my own.

I decided to research which meditation app would be the right fit for me. When I was at the hospital, the psychiatrist recommended that I start meditating regularly, which I had never done before. After some research, I landed on <a href=\"https://www.calm.com/\">Calm</a>, and that night I fell asleep to Stephen Fry reading a story about fields of lavender.</p>\n<p>Since that day, I have done some kind of meditation using the Calm app every single day. A week or so ago, I realized that I had not done my daily meditation and was at risk of breaking my 80+ day streak. It is a good thing for my brain to sit with the distress of breaking a rule that it has created for me, and I almost went to bed without doing anything to intentionally break the streak. Instead, I introduced some uncertainty. I listened to a “Sleep Story” to fall asleep that night, not knowing if that would count to continue my streak or not. It did, so my streak is alive and well. This is a streak that I am more comfortable with than most because it is not so much something that I <em>must</em> do every day, as something that I <em>want</em> to do every day.

It is much easier to sit with an emotion when you know at a deep level that it will not last forever. This allows you to fully enjoy positive emotions, and not shy away from painful ones.

A couple months ago, I wrote <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2019/02/09/splurging-on-patagonia.html\">“Splurging on Patagonia gear”</a>, in which I described my experience revamping my wardrobe. Part of the impetus of that change was considering traveling and wanting to be able to travel even lighter. I took a trip with my brother down to Mexico, and packed everything in a <a href=\"https://www.minaal.com/products/daily-bag\">21L backpack from Minaal</a>, which I loved. But while I was there, I wished at times to have a larger bag to just throw things in as I changed rooms, or to transport without packing everything carefully. I found a bag online that looked like the ideal fit for me: the <a href=\"https://www.patagonia.com/product/lightweight-black-hole-duffel-bag-30-liters/49070.html\">Patagonia Lightweight Black Hole® Duffel 30L</a>.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I have a real weakness for bags in general, and especially bags that can become small and pack in on themselves. This seemed perfect because it could be extremely small, even to where I thought I could fit it in my backpack when it was collapsed.</p>\n<p>When I returned from my trip to Mexico, this bag started to dominate my thoughts. I had already considered it for hours, finding the right bag online and looking at the specs and watching the product videos. Part of my issue was that I had no travel plans in the near future, so there was not really a reason to get the bag anytime soon. But it would not leave my mind. On some days, I would think about it occasionally, and on other days, I had a hard time thinking of anything else. If my mind was not actively engaged in something, it would slip back to this bag.</p>\n<p>Part of the struggle was that I had a plan to buy it. After shopping at <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/\">REI</a>, I had a members coupon to redeem at a certain date. I decided to use that to buy my bag when the time came. But on the day my coupon became valid, I found that they did not carry the bag I wanted. So for three days or so, I agonized over what to do. Finally, I decided that I had suffered long enough and I wanted relief and I ordered the bag straight from Patagonia. When it arrived, I found that it was actually bigger than I expected, and I am not sure if it will fit in my backpack. But I have already used it a couple of times and feel no buyer’s remorse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"everyday-ocd\">Everyday OCD</h2>\n<p>The example with the bag is a little dramatic, and one that lasted much longer than most of my obsessions. My more nuanced diagnosis is Scrupulosity OCD, which feels like a fancy word for perfectionism. In many cases, including mine, scrupulosity includes a religious component, where your mind is convinced that you are offending God through many of your actions.</p>\n<p>One of the real challenges with having this diagnosis is that it does not look like media-portrayed OCD. I do not have to flip the lights on and off a certain number of times, or wash my hands constantly throughout the day. (Although, to be honest, if I get something on my hands, I am often paralyzed and hold them suspended in front of me until I can wash so that I do not destroy anything.) What made this hard was that a number of mental health professionals with whom I met told me that I did not have OCD. One thing my brain craves is certainty, and so to not even know my diagnosis was excruciating.</p>\n<p>In practical terms, my OCD most often manifests with my family. I spent my whole childhood anticipating two things: serving <a href=\"http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/topic/missionary-program\">a religious service mission</a> for my church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and becoming a father. I read books and articles and prepared constantly. When I became a father, I found it was very different than I had imagined. The biggest difference was that I was not perfect at it. I frequently lost my temper, or failed to live up to some unrealistic ideal I had created for myself. And as a result, I would constantly punish myself emotionally. One time when we had three children, ages five, three, and two, I wrote in my journal that while I had sired children, I had yet to become a true father.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the summer of 2018, my symptoms escalated to the point where I realized that I needed to seek help. This manifested most clearly in interactions with my wife, and sometimes my children. My emotions were very close to the surface, and when I perceived that I was failing, or disappointing them, it would often trigger a <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/22/what-physical-panic.html\">physical panic attack</a>. It escalated to the point where I admitted myself to the hospital for a night. It was as if the drums had finally become too loud and too persistent to handle.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, through medication and treatment, I am beginning to experience relief from my symptoms. I am learning what it will mean to live with OCD for the rest of my life. There are days when that realization is a crushing blow. But then I remember that I have already been living with it for practically my whole life. Now I will finally have some tools to manage it.</p>",

But on the day my coupon became valid, I found that they did not carry the bag I wanted. So for three days or so, I agonized over what to do. Finally, I decided that I had suffered long enough and I wanted relief and I ordered the bag straight from Patagonia. When it arrived, I found that it was actually bigger than I expected, and I am not sure if it will fit in my backpack. But I have already used it a couple of times and feel no buyer’s remorse.\n\n## Everyday OCD\n\nThe example with the bag is a little dramatic, and one that lasted much longer than most of my obsessions. My more nuanced diagnosis is Scrupulosity OCD, which feels like a fancy word for perfectionism. In many cases, including mine, scrupulosity includes a religious component, where your mind is convinced that you are offending God through many of your actions.\n\nOne of the real challenges with having this diagnosis is that it does not look like media-portrayed OCD. I do not have to flip the lights on and off a certain number of times, or wash my hands constantly throughout the day. (Although, to be honest, if I get something on my hands, I am often paralyzed and hold them suspended in front of me until I can wash so that I do not destroy anything.) What made this hard was that a number of mental health professionals with whom I met told me that I did not have OCD. One thing my brain craves is certainty, and so to not even know my diagnosis was excruciating.\n\nIn practical terms, my OCD most often manifests with my family. I spent my whole childhood anticipating two things: serving [a religious service mission](http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/topic/missionary-program) for my church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and becoming a father. I read books and articles and prepared constantly. When I became a father, I found it was very different than I had imagined. The biggest difference was that I was not perfect at it. I frequently lost my temper, or failed to live up to some unrealistic ideal I had created for myself. And as a result, I would constantly punish myself emotionally. One time when we had three children, ages five, three, and two, I wrote in my journal that while I had sired children, I had yet to become a true father.\n\nOver the course of the summer of 2018, my symptoms escalated to the point where I realized that I needed to seek help. This manifested most clearly in interactions with my wife, and sometimes my children. My emotions were very close to the surface, and when I perceived that I was failing, or disappointing them, it would often trigger a [physical panic attack](https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/22/what-physical-panic.html). It escalated to the point where I admitted myself to the hospital for a night. It was as if the drums had finally become too loud and too persistent to handle.\n\nFortunately, through medication and treatment, I am beginning to experience relief from my symptoms. I am learning what it will mean to live with OCD for the rest of my life. There are days when that realization is a crushing blow. But then I remember that I have already been living with it for practically my whole life. Now I will finally have some tools to manage it.\n",

This seems like it would be the perfect end to one of my depressive episodes. No matter what, I know that I am going to be exhausted, and left gasping for air, either physically or mentally. But to have the sweet cleansing rush of water course through the last bits of my mind feels like the best possible outcome.\n\nThis cleansing purge is not always what comes to me at the end of a depressive episode. When it does come, it is often in the form of writing. I am able to process the overwhelming thoughts and feelings I am having through getting them out on the page. As I write, and read what I have written, I am able to identify destructive patterns and distorted thoughts that I can confront with compassion and truth. The reality is that things are rarely as bleak as my mind sees them. And nearly always they are more nuanced. I have a tendency to see everything in black and white, and the more that I can see in between two extremes, the healthier my mind can be.\n\nThe most important thing for me to remember is that any episodes, or even days, in which I am staring down the pit will come to an end. The darkness does not last forever. If you find yourself floating above a fictitious island, looking down in a dark pit, remind yourself that this, too, shall pass.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>In our efforts to reassure someone that their transgression was not overly severe, we can inadvertently trivialize the effort it took for them to apologize to us.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It is not uncommon for our natural instinct to preserve harmony and avoid discomfort to emerge when someone tries to apologize. We become uncomfortable that the other person is regretting what they have done, and seek to assure them that we are not upset. As I wrote about a few weeks ago in <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/25/replacing-sorry.html\">Replacing sorry</a>, we sometimes do this even when the other person is not apologizing.

				"content_html": "<p>I served as a <a href=\"http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/topic/missionary-program\">missionary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> in Romania for two years. During that time, we were allowed to send weekly emails, as well as periodic letters and packages to our family. We were also allowed two phone calls home per year—one on Christmas, and the other on Mother’s Day.</p>\n<p>A major change to that policy was <a href=\"https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/missionaries-family-communication\">just announced today</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Effective immediately, missionaries may communicate with their families on their weekly preparation day via text messages, online messaging, phone calls and video chat in addition to letters and emails.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My wife sent me this article, and my first reaction was that I would have struggled with this policy. Here is an example of the flexibility being introduced:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We encourage missionaries to communicate with their families each week using whatever approved method missionaries decide. This may vary based on their circumstances, locations and schedules for that week. It is not expected that all missionaries will call or video chat with their parents every week. The precise manner of communication is left up to the missionary as he or she decides what will best meet their needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am not sure that I would have been able to make judgment calls at that level. The official notice to leaders states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When communicating with their families, missionaries should be wise in considering the duration of phone calls and video chats. In making these decisions, they should be considerate of their companions and keep in mind the purpose of their service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This kind of decision-making requires a level of emotional maturity that is challenging to attain. As someone with OCD, which often manifests as excessive and unhealthy guilt, I would have had an extremely hard time making those kinds of decisions. I said to my wife:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I feel like this requires us as parents to teach our kids how to make decisions in a totally different way than I was capable of at that age.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am excited to see the effect this kind of freedom will have on young people. (Missionaries from our church typically serve under the age of 25.) They are already in a formative period of life. Having the opportunity to learn the skills required for complex emotional judgment calls will be of great benefit to them. This level of ambiguity is a much more accurate reflection of the demands of real life outside of a sheltered environment such as a full-time mission.</p>\n<p>I need to make sure that I become comfortable navigating these waters myself. Only then will I be able to pass these abilities on to my children.</p>",

In making these decisions, they should be considerate of their companions and keep in mind the purpose of their service.\n\nThis kind of decision-making requires a level of emotional maturity that is challenging to attain. As someone with OCD, which often manifests as excessive and unhealthy guilt, I would have had an extremely hard time making those kinds of decisions. I said to my wife:\n\n> I feel like this requires us as parents to teach our kids how to make decisions in a totally different way than I was capable of at that age.\n\nI am excited to see the effect this kind of freedom will have on young people. (Missionaries from our church typically serve under the age of 25.) They are already in a formative period of life. Having the opportunity to learn the skills required for complex emotional judgment calls will be of great benefit to them. This level of ambiguity is a much more accurate reflection of the demands of real life outside of a sheltered environment such as a full-time mission.\n\nI need to make sure that I become comfortable navigating these waters myself. Only then will I be able to pass these abilities on to my children.\n",

				"title": "🌀 Splurging on Patagonia gear",
				"content_html": "<p>Giving myself permission to get a few nice things has resulted in a desire to clean house and be more minimalistic. Also, spending time researching Patagonia products had a surprisingly uplifting effect on me.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I have always loved small things. And things that collapse. And things that fold in on themselves. And expensive things. It can be a problem at times.</p>\n<p>My expensive tastes combined with my OCD have posed challenges for me. When I get into my mind that I want to own something, it becomes a compulsion that can only be satisfied by purchasing the item. Making use of the item is often not required—I just have to own it. Before the iPad came out, I owned a number of digital clipboards that became abandoned in the closet, sometimes directly after being purchased.</p>\n<p>I have always felt guilty for this part of my personality. Growing up, my favorite toys were <a href=\"https://playmobil.com\">Playmobil</a>, which were pretty expensive for a city parks &amp; rec soccer referee. My paychecks were often viewed in terms of how many sets of Playmo they represented. I felt like I lacked skill and ability to manage money well. And since I spent most of my adolescence looking toward and planning for becoming a father, my inability to control spending impulses was a deep point of shame.</p>\n<p>As I have gotten older, I have curbed some of my need to buy new things. It’s not completely gone, but it has become less of a problem. Part of that is because many of the things that I really want are cost-prohibitive to buy on impulse. Another part is that I simply already own most of what I want.</p>\n<p>In one of my recent sessions, my therapist told me that at any given time in life, I will have to choose between spending money, health, and time. Prudence is usually required to make wise allocations of relatively equal capacities of those resources. However, there are times in life when we have “excess capacity” in one of those areas. Typically that occurs when there is a serious deficit in one or two of the others. Right now, due to my health being abysmally low, I definitely have more money than health. So I’ve given myself permission to buy some things that I want.</p>\n<p>My shopping spree began when <a href=\"https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/24/ultralight-by-leo.html\">I read</a> <a href=\"https://zenhabits.net/ultralight-ebook/\">Ultralight by Leo Babauta</a> a couple weeks ago. I announced to my wife, “Good news! I’m going to be a minimalist. I just need to spend $1000 or so and then I’m ready to get started!” When I told my therapist I wanted to become a minimalist, she replied, “That’s nice. Not now. Your brain is not healthy enough to make those kinds of decisions yet.” She told me that I probably was making a bargain with myself in order to have permission to buy things that I wanted, and I should just buy the things without any strings attached.</p>\n<p>So I did.</p>\n<p>Over the past couple days, I went to two R.E.I. stores and two Patagonia outlets. I bought a <a href=\"https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-micro-puff-hoody/84030.html\">Micro Puff Hoody</a>, some <a href=\"https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-short-sleeved-nine-trails-shirt/23470.html\">Nine Trails shirts</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-capilene-cool-daily-graphic-shirt/45235.html\">Capilene Daily shirt</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-baggies-shorts-5-inch/57021.html\">swimsuit</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.patagonia.com/product/lightweight-travel-mini-hip-pack-1-liter/49446.html\">hip pack</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.patagonia.com/product/lightweight-merino-performance-anklet-socks/190696744125.html\">couple pairs</a> of <a href=\"https://www.patagonia.com/product/lightweight-merino-daily-quarter-socks/190696560008.html\">socks</a>. I also went to a local sporting goods store and bought a pair of <a href=\"https://www.als.com/prana-brion-pant---mens/prana-pant_brion/product\">prAna Brion pants</a>, and some smashable but versatile <a href=\"https://www.als.com/sanuk-pick-pocket-demin-shoes---mens/sanuk-shoe_pick_pocket_denim/product\">Sanuk Pick Pocket shoes</a>. An unexpected bonus was that nearly everything was on sale for the end of the season. However, to be completely honest, I would have bought nearly all of those things at full price anyway.</p>\n<p>Before I go any further, I have to pause and acknowledge how blessed and privileged I am. When I think about how few people in the world could decide on a whim to spend a few hundred dollars and essentially replace their entire wardrobe, I am humbled. I feel keenly the sense of responsibility that comes with that privilege. Frankly, my OCD uses that to beat me over the head and tell me how horrible I am for doing something like this. But I know that’s a lie. This is not something that I should do every weekend. But. It. Is. OK.

				"content_text": "Giving myself permission to get a few nice things has resulted in a desire to clean house and be more minimalistic. Also, spending time researching Patagonia products had a surprisingly uplifting effect on me.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n***\n\nI have always loved small things. And things that collapse. And things that fold in on themselves. And expensive things. It can be a problem at times.\n\nMy expensive tastes combined with my OCD have posed challenges for me. When I get into my mind that I want to own something, it becomes a compulsion that can only be satisfied by purchasing the item. Making use of the item is often not required—I just have to own it. Before the iPad came out, I owned a number of digital clipboards that became abandoned in the closet, sometimes directly after being purchased.\n\nI have always felt guilty for this part of my personality. Growing up, my favorite toys were [Playmobil](https://playmobil.com), which were pretty expensive for a city parks & rec soccer referee. My paychecks were often viewed in terms of how many sets of Playmo they represented. I felt like I lacked skill and ability to manage money well. And since I spent most of my adolescence looking toward and planning for becoming a father, my inability to control spending impulses was a deep point of shame.\n\nAs I have gotten older, I have curbed some of my need to buy new things. It’s not completely gone, but it has become less of a problem. Part of that is because many of the things that I really want are cost-prohibitive to buy on impulse. Another part is that I simply already own most of what I want.\n\nIn one of my recent sessions, my therapist told me that at any given time in life, I will have to choose between spending money, health, and time. Prudence is usually required to make wise allocations of relatively equal capacities of those resources. However, there are times in life when we have “excess capacity” in one of those areas. Typically that occurs when there is a serious deficit in one or two of the others. Right now, due to my health being abysmally low, I definitely have more money than health. So I’ve given myself permission to buy some things that I want.\n\nMy shopping spree began when [I read](https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/24/ultralight-by-leo.html) [Ultralight by Leo Babauta](https://zenhabits.net/ultralight-ebook/) a couple weeks ago. I announced to my wife, “Good news! I’m going to be a minimalist. I just need to spend $1000 or so and then I’m ready to get started!” When I told my therapist I wanted to become a minimalist, she replied, “That’s nice. Not now. Your brain is not healthy enough to make those kinds of decisions yet.” She told me that I probably was making a bargain with myself in order to have permission to buy things that I wanted, and I should just buy the things without any strings attached.\n\nSo I did.\n\nOver the past couple days, I went to two R.E.I. stores and two Patagonia outlets. I bought a [Micro Puff Hoody](https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-micro-puff-hoody/84030.html), some [Nine Trails shirts](https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-short-sleeved-nine-trails-shirt/23470.html), a [Capilene Daily shirt](https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-capilene-cool-daily-graphic-shirt/45235.html), a [swimsuit](https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-baggies-shorts-5-inch/57021.html), a [hip pack](https://www.patagonia.com/product/lightweight-travel-mini-hip-pack-1-liter/49446.html), and a [couple pairs](https://www.patagonia.com/product/lightweight-merino-performance-anklet-socks/190696744125.html) of [socks](https://www.patagonia.com/product/lightweight-merino-daily-quarter-socks/190696560008.html). I also went to a local sporting goods store and bought a pair of [prAna Brion pants](https://www.als.com/prana-brion-pant---mens/prana-pant_brion/product), and some smashable but versatile [Sanuk Pick Pocket shoes](https://www.als.com/sanuk-pick-pocket-demin-shoes---mens/sanuk-shoe_pick_pocket_denim/product). An unexpected bonus was that nearly everything was on sale for the end of the season. However, to be completely honest, I would have bought nearly all of those things at full price anyway.\n\nBefore I go any further, I have to pause and acknowledge how blessed and privileged I am. When I think about how few people in the world could decide on a whim to spend a few hundred dollars and essentially replace their entire wardrobe, I am humbled. I feel keenly the sense of responsibility that comes with that privilege. Frankly, my OCD uses that to beat me over the head and tell me how horrible I am for doing something like this. But I know that’s a lie. This is not something that I should do every weekend. But. It. Is. OK. I am not a terrible person for buying a few things that I want and that I know I will use.\n\nI found that as I spent time in these stores, I had a subtle shift in values. It felt so good to say that I don’t need a bag while checking out. I realized that I would throw the bag away, so it was better to just not get one. It felt even better to get a smile and encouraging nod from the salesperson who appreciated the small gesture. The more I read about each item from Patagonia, and all of the care that went into designing, sourcing, and creating it, the more I wanted to make sure that I was doing good with more of my choices. I love reading about the [Fair Trade program](https://www.patagonia.com/fair-trade-certified.html):\n\n> We pay a premium for every Patagonia item that carries the Fair Trade Certified™ label. That extra money goes directly to the workers at the factory, and they decide how to spend it.\n\nAs I left the Patagonia outlet in Salt Lake City yesterday, I realized it was time for lunch, and looked around for a local restaurant, and found [Twin Suns Cafe](http://twinsunscafeslc.com) right across the street.

And, for goodness sakes, stop listening to the voices inside your head that claim you are not good enough. Just start.\n",

				"content_html": "<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Hi, I’m Ben, and I have OCD. 👋</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I am not gay. I am happily married to the woman of my dreams, and we have six wonderful children. My coming out is of an entirely different nature. Hopefully no one who is gay is offended at my co-opting the phrase “coming out”—it felt the most appropriate for the emotional struggle I have found in coming to terms with this huge part of my life and my identity.</p>\n<p>There is no one label that defines who I am. But I have realized that having OCD <em>has</em> defined a great deal of my life to this point. It feels like a big step to be able to finally acknowledge that, both to myself and to others. So, today I am announcing that I have <a href=\"https://www.ocduk.org/ocd/types/\">obsessive-compulsive disorder</a>, along with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder.</p>\n<h2 id=\"having-vs-being\">Having vs. being</h2>\n<p>When I first starting writing this post, I wrote that I <em>am</em> OCD, but as I kept writing, it felt better to change it to say I <em>have</em> OCD. That minor change in language represents a major change in my mindset, and one that I hope to preserve, or at least to come back to again and again. This issue (or any other!) does not define me, but it is something that I carry and has shaped my experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"some-background\">Some background</h2>\n<p>I grew up a member of <a href=\"https://www.lds.org\">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, and that continues to be an integral part of my life. Like in many Christian faiths, we were taught about faith <em>and</em> works. “Faith without works is dead” (<a href=\"https://www.lds.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/2?id=p26#p26\">James 2:26</a>). Unfortunately, our culture, both in my church and in my family, was one of absolutes as well as black and white thinking. Every choice was righteous or evil. Every decision brought me closer to Satan or the Savior. There was no room for gray.</p>\n<p>In this world, I thrived. I embraced black and white and one of my favorite scriptures was <a href=\"https://www.lds.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/3?id=p16#p16\">Revelation 3:16</a>,  “So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.” By no means was I perfect. But I sure tried. And when I failed, I made sure that I knew it loud and clear. In many ways, I was not alone in ensuring this. When I brought a report card home with six A’s, and an A-, I knew the reception would be, “What’s wrong? Why did you get an A-?” That became the voice inside my head.</p>\n<p>Unwittingly, I pushed myself harder and harder, and further and further into a dark place. Part of the problem was that not only was my behavior not seen and understood as unhealthy, but it was rewarded and reinforced. Years passed and I met an amazing woman, and somehow she agreed to marry me, and we started a family. I worked hard to be a good husband and father. More accurately put, I berated myself for every shortcoming when I was not a perfect husband or father.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-journey\">My journey</h2>\n<p>Last April, I had the good fortune to attend the <a href=\"http://peersconf.com/2018/\">Peers Conference</a> in Austin, Texas. On the first day, we participated in breakouts that were like group therapy sessions. I shared some of my thoughts and feelings about work, and the dissatisfaction I was feeling, and the facilitator suggested that my concerns had nothing to do with work. He suggested that I find a counselor, particularly one who shared my faith and understood that part of my life. I was taken aback—counseling was not something I had ever considered before.</p>\n<p>Over the summer, I began to see a chiropractor for the first time. I then experienced my first panic attack, and was referred to a fantastic therapist by my chiropractor. After the first visit, I told my wife, “It’s like speaking with a skilled friend.” My therapist saw through me and could identify so many of my smokescreens and crutches. As we ended the first session, she said (I’m paraphrasing a bit because I don’t remember her exact words), “You do not have perfectionistic tendencies as you suggested. You are a <em>violent</em> perfectionist and it is damaging you and your relationships.”</p>\n<p>Part of the challenge for me was in accepting that my OCD is different than what I expected. I don’t have to turn the lights off twenty times. I don’t have to wash my hands endlessly (unless, of course, I get something on them!). One of my favorite TV shows is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk_(TV_series)\">Monk</a>. I identified with so much of what he feels and says. But at the same time, I found my own situation to be so different than his that I felt sure that this is not what I have.</p>\n<p>As an aside, my wife and I were in the middle of rewatching all eight seasons of Monk when I experienced my first panic attack and started seeking help, and we decided that I had better take a break until I feel less suggestible. 😂</p>\n<p>As I met with a psychiatrist and started medication, I experienced the onset of panic disorder. We experimented with medication, and I am on my fourth try and finally starting to feel some relief. As my therapist has helped me see, part of the challenge with OCD is that it works…until it doesn’t. I have developed compulsions and coping mechanisms that are so ingrained that I don’t even recognize them as such yet. But the journey has begun.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-current-state\">My current state</h2>\n<p>I would like to think that I hit rock bottom a couple weeks ago. After a day with three panic attacks, and some unsafe thoughts, I admitted myself to a crisis center for a night to make sure that I was stable and safe. Since that point, I have continued to improve. I am surrounded by loving and caring people who have given me unconditional support.</p>\n<p>Some days, all that support makes it worse.

				"content_text": "**tl;dr** Hi, I’m Ben, and I have OCD. 👋\n\n<!--more-->\n\n***\n\nI am not gay. I am happily married to the woman of my dreams, and we have six wonderful children. My coming out is of an entirely different nature. Hopefully no one who is gay is offended at my co-opting the phrase “coming out”—it felt the most appropriate for the emotional struggle I have found in coming to terms with this huge part of my life and my identity.\n\nThere is no one label that defines who I am. But I have realized that having OCD *has* defined a great deal of my life to this point. It feels like a big step to be able to finally acknowledge that, both to myself and to others. So, today I am announcing that I have [obsessive-compulsive disorder](https://www.ocduk.org/ocd/types/), along with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder.\n\n## Having vs. being\nWhen I first starting writing this post, I wrote that I *am* OCD, but as I kept writing, it felt better to change it to say I *have* OCD. That minor change in language represents a major change in my mindset, and one that I hope to preserve, or at least to come back to again and again. This issue (or any other!) does not define me, but it is something that I carry and has shaped my experience.\n\n## Some background\nI grew up a member of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.lds.org), and that continues to be an integral part of my life. Like in many Christian faiths, we were taught about faith *and* works. “Faith without works is dead” ([James 2:26](https://www.lds.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/2?id=p26#p26)). Unfortunately, our culture, both in my church and in my family, was one of absolutes as well as black and white thinking. Every choice was righteous or evil. Every decision brought me closer to Satan or the Savior. There was no room for gray.\n\nIn this world, I thrived. I embraced black and white and one of my favorite scriptures was [Revelation 3:16](https://www.lds.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/3?id=p16#p16),  “So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.” By no means was I perfect. But I sure tried. And when I failed, I made sure that I knew it loud and clear. In many ways, I was not alone in ensuring this. When I brought a report card home with six A’s, and an A-, I knew the reception would be, “What’s wrong? Why did you get an A-?” That became the voice inside my head.\n\nUnwittingly, I pushed myself harder and harder, and further and further into a dark place. Part of the problem was that not only was my behavior not seen and understood as unhealthy, but it was rewarded and reinforced. Years passed and I met an amazing woman, and somehow she agreed to marry me, and we started a family. I worked hard to be a good husband and father. More accurately put, I berated myself for every shortcoming when I was not a perfect husband or father.\n\n## My journey\nLast April, I had the good fortune to attend the [Peers Conference](http://peersconf.com/2018/) in Austin, Texas. On the first day, we participated in breakouts that were like group therapy sessions. I shared some of my thoughts and feelings about work, and the dissatisfaction I was feeling, and the facilitator suggested that my concerns had nothing to do with work. He suggested that I find a counselor, particularly one who shared my faith and understood that part of my life. I was taken aback—counseling was not something I had ever considered before.\n\nOver the summer, I began to see a chiropractor for the first time. I then experienced my first panic attack, and was referred to a fantastic therapist by my chiropractor. After the first visit, I told my wife, “It’s like speaking with a skilled friend.” My therapist saw through me and could identify so many of my smokescreens and crutches. As we ended the first session, she said (I’m paraphrasing a bit because I don’t remember her exact words), “You do not have perfectionistic tendencies as you suggested. You are a *violent* perfectionist and it is damaging you and your relationships.”\n\nPart of the challenge for me was in accepting that my OCD is different than what I expected. I don’t have to turn the lights off twenty times. I don’t have to wash my hands endlessly (unless, of course, I get something on them!). One of my favorite TV shows is [Monk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk_(TV_series)). I identified with so much of what he feels and says. But at the same time, I found my own situation to be so different than his that I felt sure that this is not what I have.\n\nAs an aside, my wife and I were in the middle of rewatching all eight seasons of Monk when I experienced my first panic attack and started seeking help, and we decided that I had better take a break until I feel less suggestible. 😂\n\nAs I met with a psychiatrist and started medication, I experienced the onset of panic disorder. We experimented with medication, and I am on my fourth try and finally starting to feel some relief. As my therapist has helped me see, part of the challenge with OCD is that it works…until it doesn’t. I have developed compulsions and coping mechanisms that are so ingrained that I don’t even recognize them as such yet. But the journey has begun.\n\n## My current state\nI would like to think that I hit rock bottom a couple weeks ago. After a day with three panic attacks, and some unsafe thoughts, I admitted myself to a crisis center for a night to make sure that I was stable and safe. Since that point, I have continued to improve. I am surrounded by loving and caring people who have given me unconditional support.\n\nSome days, all that support makes it worse. I told a support group this week that each new relationship feels like another chance to let someone down. But I have come to accept that.\n\nThe truth is that I *will* let people down. I am *not* enough. The beauty is that I don’t have to be. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is so much more important and impactful than the culture in which I grew up. I don’t have to be enough because I have a Savior who *is* enough. That teaching got lost for me somewhere along the way, and I still struggle to hold on to it. But I have hope.\n\n## Looking forward\nSome of my fantastic support comes from people at work. My boss and HR leader suggested that I consider taking some time off to heal, which I have done. So I am on extended leave from work. I have stepped back from my volunteer church assignment. I am getting more counseling and starting to take steps toward healing.\n\nI am a long way from better. But I finally realize and accept that. It took me a while to get to this point, but I am now fine telling anyone about my situation. It is no longer a badge of shame. And it is certainly not a failure.\n\nI am Ben, and I have OCD.\n\nAnd that’s ok.\n\n***\n\n*P.S. I have tagged this post with an emoji: 💮. I plan to post occasionally about my state or my progress and will use this emoji to identify mental-health related posts. This should make it easy to find the ones that you might want to read (or skip!).*\n\n*I really liked this note on [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/white-flower/), which is why I chose it:*\n\n> *The Apple artwork contains Japanese text on the inside that translates to mean “Well Done” or “You did very well”.*\n\n*It might not be the perfect emoji for this purpose, but that is beautiful in its own way.

				"content_html": "<p>I <a href=\"https://bennorris.org/2019/01/06/at-church-today.html\">posted recently</a> an experience that I had with my son:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At church today, my six-year-old handed me a piece of his toy and asked me to fix it. After trying for just a bit, I handed it back to him. He looked at it and asked, “Daddy, did you do your best?” Then he looked up at me intently and asked again, “Did you <em>do your best</em>?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At the time, I laughed a bit at his intensity, but his two questions have continued to play in my mind. The second question communicates a level of challenge. It forces me to self evaluate and decide whether I really did give my best effort. It pushes me to keep going if I have the nagging suspicion that I could do more.</p>\n<p>This question, by itself, is something of a double-edged sword. We all need motivation to keep going when our enthusiasm is flagging. In today’s world however, there never seems to be a lack of this kind of motivation. Everywhere we turn, there is something telling us to give 110% or to dig deep and push through. The problem comes when this starts to resonate with the voice of self-doubt and self-criticism that all of us have inside. If instead of hearing, “You should give your best effort,” we hear, “You are failing to give your best,” we are going to end up in a cycle of self-loathing and despair.</p>\n<p>That is why his first question was so important. On the surface, it may seem that they were the same question. They were the same words after all. But the first question conveyed so much trust and hope. It wasn’t just, “Make sure you do your best!” It was also, “I’m sure that you did all you could. It’s ok to not complete the job all the way if you gave it all you had.” The part that was so meaningful to me as I reflected on the situation was that the trust was so automatic. His incredulity kicked in after a brief second, and he wanted to see if I just gave up or if I really did all I could.

				"content_text": "I [posted recently](https://bennorris.org/2019/01/06/at-church-today.html) an experience that I had with my son:\n\n>  At church today, my six-year-old handed me a piece of his toy and asked me to fix it. After trying for just a bit, I handed it back to him. He looked at it and asked, “Daddy, did you do your best?” Then he looked up at me intently and asked again, “Did you *do your best*?”\n\n<!--more-->\n\nAt the time, I laughed a bit at his intensity, but his two questions have continued to play in my mind. The second question communicates a level of challenge. It forces me to self evaluate and decide whether I really did give my best effort. It pushes me to keep going if I have the nagging suspicion that I could do more.\n\nThis question, by itself, is something of a double-edged sword. We all need motivation to keep going when our enthusiasm is flagging. In today’s world however, there never seems to be a lack of this kind of motivation. Everywhere we turn, there is something telling us to give 110% or to dig deep and push through. The problem comes when this starts to resonate with the voice of self-doubt and self-criticism that all of us have inside. If instead of hearing, “You should give your best effort,” we hear, “You are failing to give your best,” we are going to end up in a cycle of self-loathing and despair.\n\nThat is why his first question was so important. On the surface, it may seem that they were the same question. They were the same words after all. But the first question conveyed so much trust and hope. It wasn’t just, “Make sure you do your best!” It was also, “I’m sure that you did all you could. It’s ok to not complete the job all the way if you gave it all you had.” The part that was so meaningful to me as I reflected on the situation was that the trust was so automatic. His incredulity kicked in after a brief second, and he wanted to see if I just gave up or if I really did all I could. But his initial reaction felt like one of trust and acceptance.\n\nAs I’ve thought about this experience, I’ve wondered what life would be like if we all encountered these questions regularly. What if the first reaction to anything we did was acceptance and trust that we gave it our all, and a quiet assurance that our best is acceptable? That implied confidence makes it so much easier to face up to the second question with a straight back and square shoulders. We can look ourselves in the mirror, or look our questioner in the face, and be honest. If we have given less than our best effort, we are willing to re-engage and do more.\n\nMy hope is that I can provide more of those experiences to those around me, particularly those who are closest to me.

If the experience is starting to feel addictive, and you are anxious to create something that you want to have, that is a good sign. If you have been forcing yourself to push on just to finish what you started, you need to evaluate whether you want to continue to invest hundreds of hours in learning and continuing with iOS development. If you are learning programming for the first time, it is natural to need to reference documentation and other resources as you build your first project. Just because the solution does not come immediately to you does not mean that you lack the necessary <em>aptitude</em>. But if you finish the project, and still struggle understanding some of the basic principles, you need to do some honest introspection and decide if this is right for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-creating-your-first-app\">3. Creating your first app</h2>\n<p>The most important step is to try to create something that solves a problem that matters to you. This will stretch your ability to apply what you have learned. Up to this point, you have been focused on the “what” and “how” of iOS development. You need to advance to understanding the “when” and “why” of the different principles you have learned. When you tackle your own project, you have to determine at each step what you are trying to do, and evaluate the many options you have to solve the issue and choose the best fit and then implement it.</p>\n<p>As you start to branch out beyond guided practice, you are going to need to rely on many resources. Obviously, searching the internet for what you are trying to do is going to be the first choice for many people. The risk in doing that is getting incomplete or incorrect information. When searching for resources, I suggest prioritizing the following resources above all others.</p>\n<h3 id=\"apple-developer-marketing-y-pages\">Apple Developer marketing-y pages</h3>\n<p>Apple has done a lot of work in creating a starting point to help developers approach different topics. Whenever possible, you want to start with a marketing-type page from the Apple developer site. A great example is the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/ios/\">Apple iOS Developer page</a> for getting started in general. Most of these pages are included in the Resources list of the main <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/develop/\">Develop page</a> of the Apple Developer site. These pages are extremely helpful because they include an overview of the topic, along with curated lists of resources to dive deeper.</p>\n<h3 id=\"programming-guides\">Programming Guides</h3>\n<p>If there is not a developer landing page, or if you are ready to go deeper on a topic, you should look for a programming guide. These include detailed explanations along with sample code to help you understand a topic thoroughly. They can range from broad topics such as <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html\">App Programming Guide for iOS</a> to more specifics such as the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/content/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/\">View Controller Programming Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"source-code-documentation\">Source code documentation</h3>\n<p>Finally, you should look to the actual documentation Apple creates for the APIs you want to use. These can be found either online, or through Xcode. An example is the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller\">UIViewController documentation</a>. As you become more advanced, you will find yourself referencing this kind of documentation more and more without needing the additional explanations that come in the developer pages or programming guides. The existence of these pages is one of the main reasons that I prefer iOS development to web development. If you ever have a question about how something works, or what is possible, you can go look at the source documentation. This becomes your “Bible” and is always available for reference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-to-go-from-here\">Where to go from here</h2>\n<p>When you have made it this far, you have a decision to make. If you want iOS development to be a hobby or something you do on the side because it is fun, you can just keep trying to build more projects. If you become more serious about improving your skills and abilities, you will want to look for more advanced resources.</p>\n<p>Apple has produced a series of books designed for education that can also be used for those looking to teaching themselves. Start with <a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/intro-to-app-development-with-swift/id1118575552?mt=11&amp;at=1010lqCX\">Intro to App Development with Swift</a> is that is what you want.</p>\n<p>Another resource to consider is getting further education, such as a coding bootcamp or a college degree. Obtaining a degree in higher education is a great way to master the theory behind programming and can be a great stepping stone to future opportunities. A coding bootcamp is a much faster path to determine your <em>attitude</em> and <em>aptitude</em> fit, and to be able to start shipping apps. Often, this level of education is sufficient to start contributing as a junior developer, and you will learn even more of what is needed to succeed on the job. However, many people that finish a coding bootcamp still need to continue to invest serious time in creating apps and gaining experience before they are ready to be employed.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this has been useful if you are considering getting started with iOS development. It is a magical opportunity of pure creation. I hope you will join me on this exciting journey.</p>",

If you want iOS development to be a hobby or something you do on the side because it is fun, you can just keep trying to build more projects. If you become more serious about improving your skills and abilities, you will want to look for more advanced resources.\n\nApple has produced a series of books designed for education that can also be used for those looking to teaching themselves. Start with [Intro to App Development with Swift](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/intro-to-app-development-with-swift/id1118575552?mt=11&at=1010lqCX) is that is what you want.\n\nAnother resource to consider is getting further education, such as a coding bootcamp or a college degree. Obtaining a degree in higher education is a great way to master the theory behind programming and can be a great stepping stone to future opportunities. A coding bootcamp is a much faster path to determine your *attitude* and *aptitude* fit, and to be able to start shipping apps. Often, this level of education is sufficient to start contributing as a junior developer, and you will learn even more of what is needed to succeed on the job. However, many people that finish a coding bootcamp still need to continue to invest serious time in creating apps and gaining experience before they are ready to be employed.\n\nHopefully this has been useful if you are considering getting started with iOS development. It is a magical opportunity of pure creation. I hope you will join me on this exciting journey.\n",

However, there can sometimes be too much friction to get content published, especially short-form microblog posts. Recently, I was talking with <a href=\"http://manton.org/\">Manton Reece</a> about how to publish Instagram posts to my microblog. He mentioned that he uses <a href=\"https://workflow.is/\">Workflow</a>, a fantastic automation app for iOS, to take an Instagram photo and publish it to his WordPress blog. He wrote <a href=\"http://www.manton.org/2016/03/blogging-your-photos.html\">a post</a> about his process that was helpful as I looked at how to make this work for my needs. Another big help was a recent series about Workflow on <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/canvas\">Canvas</a>, a podcast about iPhone and iPad productivity.</p>\n<p>I only recently started posting my professional content to Instagram, such as sketchnotes and drawings, and it feels like a great fit.

				"content_text": "*Update: I published [a follow-up post](/2018/05/01/public-drafts-with.html) about incorporating drafts into the process.*\n\n## Microblog posts\nThis blog is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which has worked out extremely well for me. However, there can sometimes be too much friction to get content published, especially short-form microblog posts. Recently, I was talking with [Manton Reece](http://manton.org/) about how to publish Instagram posts to my microblog. He mentioned that he uses [Workflow](https://workflow.is/), a fantastic automation app for iOS, to take an Instagram photo and publish it to his WordPress blog. He wrote [a post](http://www.manton.org/2016/03/blogging-your-photos.html) about his process that was helpful as I looked at how to make this work for my needs. Another big help was a recent series about Workflow on [Canvas](https://www.relay.fm/canvas), a podcast about iPhone and iPad productivity.\n\nI only recently started posting my professional content to Instagram, such as sketchnotes and drawings, and it feels like a great fit. I want to keep sharing there, but I want to make sure that I have my own record of the content I am posting as well. Using [the workflow I created](https://media.bsn.design/resources/workflows/microblog-post-to-github.wflow), here are the basic steps:\n\n- While posting to Instagram, copy the caption text to the clipboard. This will be the default text for the microblog post, although I can edit it if I want.\n- Select the image in Photos, or run the workflow and select the image later.\n- Workflow creates a title for both the image and the post based on the date.\n- Confirm the post text that Workflow creates, complete with the proper front matter for posting to GitHub.\n- Workflow commits the image and, if that is successful, the text post to my blog repository using the GitHub API.\n- Optionally compose a tweet with the image and text of the post.\n\nI am pretty excited about how simple it is. I have made the workflow so that it can be launched from some text, an image, or even directly in Workflow and select the image and write the text later. This has helped reduce the friction and encourages me to post more frequently. You can still [follow me on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sketchnotable/), but all of my posts will also be available on my [microblog](/microblog/).\n\n\n## Full blog posts\nAfter getting publishing working for microblog posts, I had to keep going.

				"content_html": "<p>This will not come as a surprise to most people—writing tests makes your code better. I have come to appreciate this more over the past few months, as I wrote about <a href=\"/2016/07/14/leveling-up-with.html\">previously</a>. Also not a surprise—writing tests first makes your code even better. From my experience with iOS developers, while we might know this, most of us do not do it. Even after coming to see the value, it is easy to skip straight to writing the code. I had an experience this week that highlighted the value of this for me again, and wanted to pause and reflect before allowing myself to lose the lesson.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-story\">The story</h2>\n<p>I wrote earlier this week about <a href=\"/2016/08/31/handling-live-text.html\">handling live text reload elegantly</a>, and wanted to share a bit more about the process I went though. It went something like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>💡 Think of a great idea to add to the app</li>\n<li>🖥 Write the code to update text and preserve cursor position</li>\n<li>⌨️ Write tests to verify my code worked properly</li>\n<li>🎊 Bask in the illusion of completion</li>\n<li>🙄 Step away from the project and realize I should probably support text selection as well</li>\n<li>⌨️ Write failing tests for all the scenarios I could think of</li>\n<li>🖥 Implement the logic for text selection</li>\n<li>😒 Run the tests and realize I had broken cursor position support</li>\n<li>😅 Repeat previous two steps until everything passed</li>\n<li>🎉 Write an exultant blog post</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"the-realization\">The realization</h2>\n<p>After I was done, it hit me how different it was to write the code before the tests instead of vice versa. When the code came first, my tests just verified my code. I had come up with all the scenarios I thought I needed to support, and had coded them, so I just made sure that they worked as I intended.</p>\n<p>However, when I wrote the tests first, it was a completely different mental exercise. I was not worried about how I was going to implement the different scenarios—I was just focused on thinking of all possible scenarios. Not only did I think of many different cases for text selection, but I realized that I had omitted a number of cases for cursor position as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-takeaway\">The takeaway</h2>\n<p>My adherence to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development\">TDD</a> has ebbed and flowed over time. It is easy to want to jump straight into writing the code and seeing something work in the simulator. But taking the time at the beginning to consider the desired behavior, and writing tests for that behavior makes for better code and fewer rewrites and regressions.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, it can feel impossible to start with tests. Your tests will not compile if the objects they are testing do not exist yet. One approach that has worked well for me is to start by writing descriptive function names for tests, and then moving on to writing the rest of everything. The process looks something like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a test case class and write empty test functions</li>\n<li>Create objects with properties and stubbed functions</li>\n<li>Fill in failing tests to verify behavior</li>\n<li>Implement the functions and logic needed for the tests to pass</li>\n<li>Adjust tests and code as needed</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the most exciting aspects to programming is how much you learn while you are working through something. Invariably, you will have to make changes to the tests as you think through the implementation details. The trick is to make sure that your tests remain focused on the behavior, and not the actual implementation details. That way, if you refactor the implementation, your tests can still verify that the behavior remains intact.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-conclusion\">The conclusion</h2>\n<p>A major benefit to using this approach is that it helps you write more reusable code, which has been a <a href=\"/2016/07/05/writing-reusable-code.html\">focus of mine</a> lately. You still need to learn about good design patterns and best practices. But starting with your tests means that you are exercising the API from the beginning, and that will help you think through having a good API as you build it.</p>\n<p>Part of my purpose in writing this post is to help myself recommit to TDD in all of my projects. It is too easy to get lazy and skip the tests altogether. That is part of why I have put build, coverage and version badges on all of my open-source project pages on this site. I am hoping that the shame of not having tests and builds and coverage will help motivate me to get this done quickly. My future self will thank me later.</p>\n",

When the code came first, my tests just verified my code. I had come up with all the scenarios I thought I needed to support, and had coded them, so I just made sure that they worked as I intended.\n\nHowever, when I wrote the tests first, it was a completely different mental exercise. I was not worried about how I was going to implement the different scenarios&#x2014;I was just focused on thinking of all possible scenarios. Not only did I think of many different cases for text selection, but I realized that I had omitted a number of cases for cursor position as well.\n\n## The takeaway\nMy adherence to [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) has ebbed and flowed over time. It is easy to want to jump straight into writing the code and seeing something work in the simulator. But taking the time at the beginning to consider the desired behavior, and writing tests for that behavior makes for better code and fewer rewrites and regressions.\n\nSometimes, it can feel impossible to start with tests. Your tests will not compile if the objects they are testing do not exist yet. One approach that has worked well for me is to start by writing descriptive function names for tests, and then moving on to writing the rest of everything. The process looks something like this:\n\n1. Create a test case class and write empty test functions\n1. Create objects with properties and stubbed functions\n1. Fill in failing tests to verify behavior\n1. Implement the functions and logic needed for the tests to pass\n1. Adjust tests and code as needed\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects to programming is how much you learn while you are working through something. Invariably, you will have to make changes to the tests as you think through the implementation details. The trick is to make sure that your tests remain focused on the behavior, and not the actual implementation details. That way, if you refactor the implementation, your tests can still verify that the behavior remains intact.\n\n## The conclusion\nA major benefit to using this approach is that it helps you write more reusable code, which has been a [focus of mine](/2016/07/05/writing-reusable-code.html) lately. You still need to learn about good design patterns and best practices. But starting with your tests means that you are exercising the API from the beginning, and that will help you think through having a good API as you build it.\n\nPart of my purpose in writing this post is to help myself recommit to TDD in all of my projects. It is too easy to get lazy and skip the tests altogether. That is part of why I have put build, coverage and version badges on all of my open-source project pages on this site. I am hoping that the shame of not having tests and builds and coverage will help motivate me to get this done quickly. My future self will thank me later.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>In my current project at my day job, we are using <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com\">Firebase</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift\">ReSwift</a>. I plan to write more about this powerful combination soon. One of the major advantages is that it allows us to easily support live reloading of concurrent editing. However, I ran into a problem in long-form text editing. It was impressive to see the text update while someone else edited the same data, but if you were also trying to type, it would get extremely frustrating. With every reload, your cursor would jump to the end of the text, making it nearly impossible to keep working.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite podcasts, <a href=\"https://spec.fm/podcasts/runtime\">Runtime</a>, recently mentioned approaches to diffing text. I reached out to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/soffes\">Sam Soffes</a>, who pointed me to a simple library he created for this, <a href=\"https://github.com/soffes/diff\">diff</a>.</p>\n<p>Using that library, I was ready to tackle preserving the cursor position and text selection when the underlying text changed. In the hopes that others can benefit from or improve this work, here is the code that I am using:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">func</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">updateText</span>(with newString: String?) {\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">guard</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> textView = textView, newString = newString,\n      (diffRange, changedText) = diff(textView.text, newString) <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">else</span> { <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">return</span> }\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">guard</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> selectedRange = textView.selectedTextRange <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">else</span> { textView.text = newString; <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">return</span> }\n    textView.text = newString\n\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> cursorOffset = textView.offsetFromPosition(textView.beginningOfDocument, toPosition: selectedRange.start)\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> selectedEndOffset = textView.offsetFromPosition(textView.beginningOfDocument, toPosition: selectedRange.end)\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> selectedRangeLength = selectedEndOffset <span style=\"color:#f92672\">-</span> cursorOffset\n\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">if</span> selectedEndOffset &amp;lt; diffRange.startIndex {\n        <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// Change is after current cursor</span>\n        moveCursorRelativeToBeginning(with: cursorOffset, rangeLength: selectedRangeLength)\n    } <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">else</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">if</span> cursorOffset &amp;lt; diffRange.startIndex &amp;amp;&amp;amp; selectedEndOffset &amp;gt; diffRange.endIndex {\n        <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// Change occurs within selection</span>\n        moveCursorRelativeToBeginning(with: cursorOffset, rangeLength: selectedRangeLength <span style=\"color:#f92672\">+</span> changedText.characters.count <span style=\"color:#f92672\">-</span> diffRange.count)\n    } <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">else</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">if</span> cursorOffset &amp;gt;= diffRange.endIndex {\n        <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// Change occurs completely before current cursor</span>\n        moveCursorRelativeToBeginning(with: cursorOffset <span style=\"color:#f92672\">+</span> changedText.characters.count <span style=\"color:#f92672\">-</span> diffRange.count, rangeLength: selectedRangeLength)\n    } <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">else</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">if</span> diffRange.startIndex &amp;lt; selectedEndOffset &amp;amp;&amp;amp; diffRange.startIndex &amp;gt; cursorOffset {\n        <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// Change starts in middle of selection</span>\n        moveCursorRelativeToBeginning(with: cursorOffset, rangeLength: selectedRangeLength <span style=\"color:#f92672\">-</span> (selectedEndOffset <span style=\"color:#f92672\">-</span> diffRange.startIndex))\n    } <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">else</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">if</span> diffRange.startIndex &amp;lt;= cursorOffset &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cursorOffset &amp;lt; diffRange.endIndex {\n        <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// Change is a removal/change over the current cursor position</span>\n        <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> rangeLength = selectedRangeLength <span style=\"color:#f92672\">-</span> (diffRange.endIndex <span style=\"color:#f92672\">-</span> cursorOffset)\n        moveCursorRelativeToBeginning(with: cursorOffset <span style=\"color:#f92672\">-</span> (cursorOffset <span style=\"color:#f92672\">-</span> diffRange.startIndex) <span style=\"color:#f92672\">+</span> changedText.characters.count, rangeLength: rangeLength &amp;gt; <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">0</span> ? rangeLength : <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">0</span>)\n    }\n}\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">private</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">func</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">moveCursorRelativeToBeginning</span>(with offset: Int, rangeLength: Int = <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">0</span>) {\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">guard</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> textView = textView, startPosition = textView.positionFromPosition(textView.beginningOfDocument, offset: offset), endPosition = textView.positionFromPosition(startPosition, offset: rangeLength) <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">else</span> { <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">return</span> }\n    textView.selectedTextRange = textView.textRangeFromPosition(startPosition, toPosition: endPosition)\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>This is even more useful when combined with the automated tests that ensure that it is working properly.

href=\"https://gist.github.com/benjaminsnorris/710d22ef066ae249156f7f959be7debe\">Gist</a> with all of the code.</p>\n<p><em>Edit: Since writing this, I decided to pull all of this code into a simple library: <a href=\"https://github.com/benjaminsnorris/TextMagic\">TextMagic</a>.</em></p>\n",
				"content_text": "In my current project at my day job, we are using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and [ReSwift](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift). I plan to write more about this powerful combination soon. One of the major advantages is that it allows us to easily support live reloading of concurrent editing. However, I ran into a problem in long-form text editing. It was impressive to see the text update while someone else edited the same data, but if you were also trying to type, it would get extremely frustrating. With every reload, your cursor would jump to the end of the text, making it nearly impossible to keep working.\n\nOne of my favorite podcasts, [Runtime](https://spec.fm/podcasts/runtime), recently mentioned approaches to diffing text. I reached out to [Sam Soffes](https://twitter.com/soffes), who pointed me to a simple library he created for this, [diff](https://github.com/soffes/diff).\n\nUsing that library, I was ready to tackle preserving the cursor position and text selection when the underlying text changed. In the hopes that others can benefit from or improve this work, here is the code that I am using:\n\n```swift\nfunc updateText(with newString: String?) {\n    guard let textView = textView, newString = newString,\n      (diffRange, changedText) = diff(textView.text, newString) else { return }\n    guard let selectedRange = textView.selectedTextRange else { textView.text = newString; return }\n    textView.text = newString\n\n    let cursorOffset = textView.offsetFromPosition(textView.beginningOfDocument, toPosition: selectedRange.start)\n    let selectedEndOffset = textView.offsetFromPosition(textView.beginningOfDocument, toPosition: selectedRange.end)\n    let selectedRangeLength = selectedEndOffset - cursorOffset\n\n    if selectedEndOffset &lt; diffRange.startIndex {\n        // Change is after current cursor\n        moveCursorRelativeToBeginning(with: cursorOffset, rangeLength: selectedRangeLength)\n    } else if cursorOffset &lt; diffRange.startIndex &amp;&amp; selectedEndOffset &gt; diffRange.endIndex {\n        // Change occurs within selection\n        moveCursorRelativeToBeginning(with: cursorOffset, rangeLength: selectedRangeLength + changedText.characters.count - diffRange.count)\n    } else if cursorOffset &gt;= diffRange.endIndex {\n        // Change occurs completely before current cursor\n        moveCursorRelativeToBeginning(with: cursorOffset + changedText.characters.count - diffRange.count, rangeLength: selectedRangeLength)\n    } else if diffRange.startIndex &lt; selectedEndOffset &amp;&amp; diffRange.startIndex &gt; cursorOffset {\n        // Change starts in middle of selection\n        moveCursorRelativeToBeginning(with: cursorOffset, rangeLength: selectedRangeLength - (selectedEndOffset - diffRange.startIndex))\n    } else if diffRange.startIndex &lt;= cursorOffset &amp;&amp; cursorOffset &lt; diffRange.endIndex {\n        // Change is a removal/change over the current cursor position\n        let rangeLength = selectedRangeLength - (diffRange.endIndex - cursorOffset)\n        moveCursorRelativeToBeginning(with: cursorOffset - (cursorOffset - diffRange.startIndex) + changedText.characters.count, rangeLength: rangeLength &gt; 0 ? rangeLength : 0)\n    }\n}\n\nprivate func moveCursorRelativeToBeginning(with offset: Int, rangeLength: Int = 0) {\n    guard let textView = textView, startPosition = textView.positionFromPosition(textView.beginningOfDocument, offset: offset), endPosition = textView.positionFromPosition(startPosition, offset: rangeLength) else { return }\n    textView.selectedTextRange = textView.textRangeFromPosition(startPosition, toPosition: endPosition)\n}\n```\n\nThis is even more useful when combined with the automated tests that ensure that it is working properly. Here are all of the tests:\n\n```swift\nimport XCTest\nimport Nimble\nimport Diff\n@testable import align\n\nclass TextEditingSpec: XCTestCase {\n\n    var textEditing: TextEditing!\n\n    override func setUp() {\n        super.setUp()\n        textEditing = TextEditing.initializeFromStoryboard()\n        let _ = textEditing.view\n        textEditing.textView = UITextView()\n    }\n\n    ///

				"title": "Retrieving iOS shared web credentials",
				"content_html": "<h2 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h2>\n<p>One of the most annoying interactions with any app or service is logging in. None of us likes having to remember usernames and passwords, and often they are difficult to type in. Even if they are easy, it is never what you actually want to do. You are accessing an app or service in order to accomplish a task, and logging in is a barrier to success. However, none of us want to feel like our sensitive information is not secure, so logging in is something of a necessary evil.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-solution\">The solution</h2>\n<p>One thing that you can do as a developer is to make this experience as simple and painless as possible. One option, which I plan to discuss in the future, is to integrate with <a href=\"https://1password.com/\">1Password</a>. This is a popular password management app, and integration is quite simple.</p>\n<p>Another approach is what I want to cover today: integrating with Shared Web Credentials, or from a user’s perspective, integrating with Safari saved passwords. This is available since iOS 8, and is an effective way to simplify life for your users. You should read the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Security/Reference/SharedWebCredentialsRef/\">official documentation</a>, but I will go through the steps that I did in order to retrieve passwords successfully. In a future post, I will address creating an account and saving a new password.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-steps\">The steps</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Add entitlement and configure app</li>\n<li>Upload site association file to server</li>\n<li>Add password to Safari on Simulator or device</li>\n<li>Add code to retrieve password</li>\n<li>Run app</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"entitlement\">Entitlement</h3>\n<p>Xcode does a great job of simplifying the process of adding entitlements. In order to use shared web credentials, you need to enable the <code>Associated Domains</code> entitlement:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/97cfca51e9.png\">Associated domains</a></p>\n<p>Then in place of <code>example.com</code>, you need to put your domain. Read through the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Security/Reference/SharedWebCredentialsRef/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014989-CH1-DontLinkElementID_5\">documentation</a> for this section to make sure that you do not miss anything.</p>\n<h3 id=\"site-association-file\">Site association file</h3>\n<p>In order for the association to work, you have to upload a simple JSON file to your server. Even if you do not have a web app that users will sign in to, as long as you have a website for your app, you can upload the file and make it easier for your users to log in on additional devices. The file should be named <code>apple-app-site-association</code> with no extension, and is simple JSON. It should look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-json\" data-lang=\"json\">{\n  <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;webcredentials&#34;</span>: {\n    <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;apps&#34;</span>: [\n      <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;D3KQX62K1A.com.example.DemoApp&#34;</span>\n    ]\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Inside the <code>apps</code> array, you should list all of the bundle identifiers for apps that should be able to share passwords from this site. The prefix to the bundle identifier is usually your Team ID. To be sure, pull up the app in <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle\">developer.apple.com</a> and copy the prefix from the App ID information.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/556b99b323.png\">App prefix</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"safari-password\">Safari password</h3>\n<p>Since we are focusing on retrieving passwords, and not saving them from the app, it will make testing easier to manually add the password to the device you are going to test on. I will include instructions for using the Simulator, but the same basic steps apply if you are using a physical device.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Settings app</li>\n<li>Tap on “Safari”</li>\n<li>Tap on “Passwords”</li>\n<li>Enter <code>1234</code> for the passcode</li>\n<li>Tap on “Add Password”</li>\n<li>Enter your website and a user name and password</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/262fb590d2.jpg\">Safari passwords</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"code\">Code</h3>\n<p>There are many approaches to retrieving the shared password.

				"content_text": "## The problem\nOne of the most annoying interactions with any app or service is logging in. None of us likes having to remember usernames and passwords, and often they are difficult to type in. Even if they are easy, it is never what you actually want to do. You are accessing an app or service in order to accomplish a task, and logging in is a barrier to success. However, none of us want to feel like our sensitive information is not secure, so logging in is something of a necessary evil.\n\n## The solution\nOne thing that you can do as a developer is to make this experience as simple and painless as possible. One option, which I plan to discuss in the future, is to integrate with [1Password](https://1password.com/). This is a popular password management app, and integration is quite simple.\n\nAnother approach is what I want to cover today: integrating with Shared Web Credentials, or from a user&#x2019;s perspective, integrating with Safari saved passwords. This is available since iOS 8, and is an effective way to simplify life for your users. You should read the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Security/Reference/SharedWebCredentialsRef/), but I will go through the steps that I did in order to retrieve passwords successfully. In a future post, I will address creating an account and saving a new password.\n\n## The steps\n1. Add entitlement and configure app\n1. Upload site association file to server\n1. Add password to Safari on Simulator or device\n1. Add code to retrieve password\n1. Run app\n\n\n### Entitlement\nXcode does a great job of simplifying the process of adding entitlements. In order to use shared web credentials, you need to enable the `Associated Domains` entitlement:\n\n[Associated domains](https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/97cfca51e9.png)\n\nThen in place of `example.com`, you need to put your domain. Read through the [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Security/Reference/SharedWebCredentialsRef/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014989-CH1-DontLinkElementID_5) for this section to make sure that you do not miss anything.\n\n\n### Site association file\nIn order for the association to work, you have to upload a simple JSON file to your server. Even if you do not have a web app that users will sign in to, as long as you have a website for your app, you can upload the file and make it easier for your users to log in on additional devices. The file should be named `apple-app-site-association` with no extension, and is simple JSON. It should look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"webcredentials\": {\n    \"apps\": [\n      \"D3KQX62K1A.com.example.DemoApp\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nInside the `apps` array, you should list all of the bundle identifiers for apps that should be able to share passwords from this site. The prefix to the bundle identifier is usually your Team ID. To be sure, pull up the app in [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle) and copy the prefix from the App ID information.\n\n[App prefix](https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/556b99b323.png)\n\n\n### Safari password\nSince we are focusing on retrieving passwords, and not saving them from the app, it will make testing easier to manually add the password to the device you are going to test on. I will include instructions for using the Simulator, but the same basic steps apply if you are using a physical device.\n\n1. Open the Settings app\n1. Tap on &#x201C;Safari&#x201D;\n1. Tap on &#x201C;Passwords&#x201D;\n1. Enter `1234` for the passcode\n1. Tap on &#x201C;Add Password&#x201D;\n1. Enter your website and a user name and password\n\n[Safari passwords](https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/262fb590d2.jpg)\n\n\n### Code\nThere are many approaches to retrieving the shared password. The method I have chosen is to make the call to retrieve the shared password when the user taps on the username or password field in the login form. That way, it is not as jarring for the user when first navigating to the form, but it is still helpful at the moment the user wants to take action.\n\nThe actual code for retrieving the credentials is fairly simple. Here is an example with a completion closure that returns an optional username and password.\n\n```swift\nfunc requestSharedPassword(completion: (username: String?, password: String?) -&gt; ()) {\n  SecRequestSharedWebCredential(nil, nil) { credentials, error in\n    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue()) {\n      guard error == nil else {\n        completion(username: nil, password: nil)\n        return\n      }\n      guard let unwrappedCredentials = credentials else {\n        completion(username: nil, password: nil)\n        return\n      }\n      let arrayCredentials = unwrappedCredentials as [AnyObject]\n      guard let typedCredentials = arrayCredentials as? [[String: AnyObject]] else {\n        completion(username: nil, password: nil)\n        return\n      }\n      guard let credential = typedCredentials.first else {\n        completion(username: nil, password: nil)\n        return\n      }\n      guard let username = credential[String(kSecAttrAccount)] as? String,\n                password = credential[String(kSecSharedPassword)] as? String else {\n        completion(username: nil, password: nil)\n        return\n      }\n      completion(username: username, password: password)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nfunc textFieldDidBeginEditing(textField: UITextField) {\n  requestSharedPassword { username, password in\n    guard let username = username, password = password else { return }\n    usernameField.text = username\n    passwordField.text = password\n    self.submit()\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n### Execution\nFinally, with the code in place, you can run the app again. When the user taps in the username or password field, call your `requestSharedPassword` function, and if everything is set up properly, you will see something like this example from an app I am currently working on:\n\n[Shared credentials](https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/4a1327e4a0.png)\n\n## Summary\nAnd that is it! These steps really are simple and straightforward, but the effect on the user experience of your app is tremendous.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>At the beginning of this year, I was put on a new team at work. We had the chance to a build a project completely from scratch. When I joined the team, they had already spent a few months interviewing potential customers and learning about the market, and were ready to build a prototype. I was tasked with creating a quick, simple version of the app that stored all data locally. I knew that I would be rebuilding the app a couple times, or at least refactoring major portions of the app. So I set out to build portions of the app in ways that I could easily reuse them multiple times, and across multiple projects.</p>\n<p>One thing that has made this easier is that my employer has been generous in allowing large portions of my work to be open-source. As I worked on my project, I was conscious to separate app-specific code from reusable pieces that could be made into frameworks or libraries.</p>\n<p>One of the first areas that I tackled was to create a network stack built on top of <code>NSURLSession</code> that provided a simple interface to make network requests. The end result is somewhat specific to our projects at O.C. Tanner, but we made it open-source in case it is useful to anyone else: <a href=\"https://github.com/octanner/ios-network-stack\">ios-network-stack</a>.</p>\n<p>Since then, I have made a number of libraries that I use across different apps. Most of the libraries are not to the level that I would like yet—I need to add automated tests, better code documentation, and useful readme files. But I have learned a number of things in creating and using these libraries, and thought it would be useful to go through some of the pros and cons.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cons\">Cons</h2>\n<h3 id=\"dependency-management\">Dependency management</h3>\n<p>For a long time, I resisted adding any dependencies to my projects. It felt much simpler to just focus on the project at hand, and build anything that was needed specific to the project. Dealing with a system such as <a href=\"https://cocoapods.org/\">Cocoapods</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage\">Carthage</a> felt like too much overhead. Part of my reaction came from working on projects where previous developers had pulled in so many dependencies that the project became unwieldy and difficult to update and maintain. We experimented with different approaches and finally landed on using Carthage and Git submodules, which I <a href=\"/2016/06/02/using-carthage-to.html\">described earlier</a>.</p>\n<p>Part of the key in managing dependencies reliably is being able to choose when to update those dependencies.

				"content_text": "At the beginning of this year, I was put on a new team at work. We had the chance to a build a project completely from scratch. When I joined the team, they had already spent a few months interviewing potential customers and learning about the market, and were ready to build a prototype. I was tasked with creating a quick, simple version of the app that stored all data locally. I knew that I would be rebuilding the app a couple times, or at least refactoring major portions of the app. So I set out to build portions of the app in ways that I could easily reuse them multiple times, and across multiple projects.\n\nOne thing that has made this easier is that my employer has been generous in allowing large portions of my work to be open-source. As I worked on my project, I was conscious to separate app-specific code from reusable pieces that could be made into frameworks or libraries.\n\nOne of the first areas that I tackled was to create a network stack built on top of `NSURLSession` that provided a simple interface to make network requests. The end result is somewhat specific to our projects at O.C. Tanner, but we made it open-source in case it is useful to anyone else: [ios-network-stack](https://github.com/octanner/ios-network-stack).\n\nSince then, I have made a number of libraries that I use across different apps. Most of the libraries are not to the level that I would like yet&#x2014;I need to add automated tests, better code documentation, and useful readme files. But I have learned a number of things in creating and using these libraries, and thought it would be useful to go through some of the pros and cons.\n\n\n## Cons\n\n### Dependency management\nFor a long time, I resisted adding any dependencies to my projects. It felt much simpler to just focus on the project at hand, and build anything that was needed specific to the project. Dealing with a system such as [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) or [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) felt like too much overhead. Part of my reaction came from working on projects where previous developers had pulled in so many dependencies that the project became unwieldy and difficult to update and maintain. We experimented with different approaches and finally landed on using Carthage and Git submodules, which I [described earlier](/2016/06/02/using-carthage-to.html).\n\nPart of the key in managing dependencies reliably is being able to choose when to update those dependencies. If your code changes out from under you when you are not expecting it, development becomes much more difficult. Using Carthage and submodules means that I decide exactly when to update, and can choose which version of a given dependency to keep in my project. So if I need to use an older version for compatibility issues, or an experimental branch, that is easy to do.\n\n### Extra time cost\nOne of the biggest frustrations with adding dependencies is the additional time investment at the beginning of a project. Especially if something goes wrong, it can be extremely frustrating to want to just start coding, and instead have to deal with dependency problems.\n\nAgain, this is one of the reasons that I have decided on the system that I currently use. I use [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/) as a Git client, and it has made working with submodules extremely simple. If someone needs to check out the repo, they can just initialize the submodules, and they will have the entire project set up and ready to go. When starting a project, it is a simple process to set up the project, although there are a number of steps that can feel intimidating at first.\n\n### Maintenance\nOne significant issue that you have to be aware of when creating open-source projects is the possibility that they will become successful. Once an open-source project starts being used by more people, and especially when they start contributing, it requires much more of a time investment. There will come pull requests to review and merge, issues to triage, and questions to answer. Hopefully this also comes with the benefit of having the code improved by getting more real-word usage, and contributions back to the project. But as the project creator, you have to evaluate whether the benefit will be worth the cost.\n\n## Pros\n\n### Quicker project spin up\nIn practice, I have found that the time balance comes out in favor of using dependencies. I only have a few third-party libraries that I am pulling in&#x2014;many of my dependencies are internal libraries that I maintain and share across my projects. Splitting that code out into reusable libraries means that in each project, I can focus on the app-specific logic.

As I find interesting approaches to problems, or identify areas of boilerplate code that can easily be reused, it is a great feeling knowing that I am making it possible for others to benefit from that as well.\n\nOf course, since I am still enjoying the [luxury of obscurity](/2016/05/31/the-luxury-of.html), I do not feel the pressure of having all of my projects perfectly documented, tested, and maintained. I still plan on working toward that goal, but I know I have time.

				"content_html": "<p>After consuming much of WWDC last week, I wanted to take a few minutes and consider how my apps could be affected by the new announcements. Since I mostly sat in my office at home and watched live session videos, some effort is required to make sure that the videos can translate into action and improvement. I thought I would take each of my active projects in turn, or rather active and semi-active projects, and consider the state of the app, and how I might incorporate some new technologies. Most of this will be “thinking out loud” so that I can try and process some of what I learned.</p>\n<h2 id=\"align\">Align</h2>\n<p>Align is a new app that I am helping create in my day job at <a href=\"http://labs.octanner.com/\">Tanner Labs</a>. Our focus is to make managers better by leveraging the one-on-one. The tool will start out simple, as a way for managers to track one-on-ones and help them prepare, execute, and follow up. We will be launching this with both an iOS app and a web app, built on Firebase as a back end.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sirikithttpsdeveloperapplecomsirikit\"><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/sirikit/\">SiriKit</a></h3>\n<p>One of the first thing that I thought of is the possibilities of integrating with Siri. As Apple expands Siri to be integrated with third-party apps, they are starting with six domains: messaging, voice/video calls, payment, ride sharing, workouts, and photo search. Of those, I think that messaging could potentially be a good fit.</p>\n<h4 id=\"comments\">Comments</h4>\n<p>One of the keys with a one-on-one is the comments that can go back and forth between the manager and team member leading up to the meeting. That can help the team member to feel engaged and empowered to affect the content of the meeting, and to avoid anxiety or the “called-to-the-principal’s-office” feeling. Part of the challenge with integrating with SiriKit would be identifying which one-on-one to add comments to, so I think I would either have to default to the next one coming up, or consider scheduling one through the interaction. This kind of experience is not exactly what Apple seemed to have in mind, so I will have to explore it more and see how it might feel.</p>\n<h4 id=\"coaching-items\">Coaching Items</h4>\n<p>An interaction that we have considered for Align is the ability for a manager to create a coaching item for a team member. This would be essentially a note that the manager creates to follow up with the team member on some point, whether to praise and recognize or to provide correction. The idea is that it should be an extremely quick interaction to capture something that would then be discussed later with the team member. This was actually one of the first things that came to my mind with SiriKit and Align, but as I think about it more, I think that it might not be the right fit. For the messaging domain, Siri is expecting to get a recipient from the user. The voice prompt would be something like, “Tell John using Align that…” The problem that I see is that the resulting action would be to create a coaching item for the manager to discuss with the employee later. It makes sense as a use case, but we will have to see if the interaction feels natural.</p>\n<h3 id=\"imessage-apphttpsdeveloperapplecomimessage\"><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/imessage/\">iMessage App</a></h3>\n<p>Making Messages into a platform allows for much richer interactions that start while messaging with someone, and never leave that experience. I anticipate that some of the best implementations of this will be collaborative experiences, where the participants can go back and forth on something before it is finalized. This seems like it might be a great fit for preparing for a one-on-one. It would allow for a manager to send a team member the proposed agenda and other details for the one-on-one, and for the team member to have an easy way to provide input, or make suggestions to the agenda. This kind of interaction would require the team member to have the app as well, so we may or may not want to pursue this, but I think it could be powerful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notification-service-extensionhttpsdeveloperapplecomnotifications\"><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/notifications/\">Notification Service Extension</a></h3>\n<p>With iOS 10, notifications are now a powerful interaction point, and I want to make sure that we take full advantage of this. We will need to think through the design of a custom UI to show with notifications. We will have different kinds of notifications that users will receive, and each will have to be considered separately. One of the main things that should be featured in our notifications is the images of the team members involved in the notification. That will make it easy for a user to connect with the information and to encourage a personal approach.</p>\n<h3 id=\"searchhttpsdeveloperapplecomiossearch\"><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/ios/search/\">Search</a></h3>\n<p>In iOS 9, Spotlight integration was added, and this is definitely a feature that we should take advantage of. It should be simple for a user to find their one-on-one information by searching on the phone. With the addition of app search integration into Spotlight, this becomes even more compelling. As we build search into the app, I need to make sure that we do it in a way that we can easily facilitate this powerful interaction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"watchos-3httpwwwapplecomwatchos-preview\"><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/watchos-preview/\">watchOS 3</a></h3>\n<p>I have been planning on building some kind of Apple Watch app, although I am not sure exactly what the focus should be. However, with some of the changes in watchOS 3, I think the focus is much clearer. Since apps will stay “active” for eight minutes after launching them, it becomes much more feasible to have a Watch app be a reference point. If you are in a one-on-one, it could be powerful to have your agenda easily glanceable on your wrist so that you can be checking as you go to make sure that you both stay on time with the meeting, and cover everything you intended. A natural complication would be to see the next or current one-on-one, and that would make it easy to launch the app and be ready to execute the one-on-one. An implication of that interaction could be to make the agenda points completable, so that you could check them off as you go, in order to remember what is left. We will have to see where that goes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>Many of the system-level integrations in iOS 10 are focused around location- and communication-type apps, which does not exactly fit Align. For example, it would not make sense for Align to become the preferred messaging app for communicating with someone, and so I would not want to provide that information to Contacts. I need to make sure that I appropriately tag any input fields so that I can get meaningful Quick Type suggestions for things like people, contact information, or locations. I should also take advantage of the Universal Clipboard, and make sure that I am a good citizen there. I think that is about it for Align. Good stuff!</p>\n<h2 id=\"pointedly\">Pointedly</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://bsn.design/pointedly\">Pointedly</a> is actually my first app released to the App Store, and continues to be one of my favorites to work on. It is a simple app to keep score in board games, or card games, or anything else that could use tracking. In many ways, it has served the purpose of being a playground for me to try out new technologies as they make sense for the app. It is currently a stand-alone app on the iPhone with the data not synced or shared in any way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cloudkit-sharinghttpsdeveloperapplecomicloud\"><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/icloud/\">CloudKit Sharing</a></h3>\n<p>This is huge for me. I have been wanting to build a back-end syncing mechanism for Pointedly so that you can easily track all of your games across your devices, but I have not implemented one yet. Part of the reason was that I wanted to be able to share games, and had not decided on the easiest way to do that yet. This feature is exactly what I was hoping for in CloudKit, without even thinking of it as a possibility. I had wanted to explore different options for collaborating on a pointcard, such as having it be public, and allowing anyone to join, or sharing with an individual. From the session explaining this, I think that I can accomplish exactly what I want while keeping the data private and only shared as needed. You can either share with a specified individual, or else anyone with the link so that you could post the link in some place like Slack for anyone to join that had access. There are still a number of things that I need to think through here, like how to share the players that are involved in a game, but this is definitely the answer for me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"imessage-apphttpsdeveloperapplecomimessage-1\"><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/imessage/\">iMessage App</a></h3>\n<p>I am not completely sure about this yet, but I have been thinking that it would be fun to send someone a pointcard in Messages, and collaborate with them that way. It seems that there are a limited set of scenarios when this would make sense, and most of them would probably be better served by using CloudKit Sharing from within the app, but it remains an intriguing possibility. This is also a technology that I want to understand better, so in some ways I want to explore adding this just to gain experience with it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"watchos-3httpwwwapplecomwatchos-preview-1\"><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/watchos-preview/\">watchOS 3</a></h3>\n<p>Now that Apple Watch will have directly CloudKit support, and I will probably be adding CloudKit, this makes more sense. Combined with the enhancements to keep the app running for longer, using your watch to quickly enter the score for a game feels like a great feature. The crucial thing would be to figure out how to allow for a score entry that can easily be done in under two seconds. You have to select the player and input the score in the way that makes sense and then easily get an overview of the game progress. I will have to decide about creating a pointcard, and whether to allow that on the watch, or to require the iPhone for that. It seems like it would make more sense on the iPhone, but if I can find a fast way to do it on the watch, that would be nice. Finally, I think I would definitely want to use Handoff and encourage the user to go back to the phone to share the results at the end of the game.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tvos-10httpwwwapplecomtvos-preview\"><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/tvos-preview/\">tvOS 10</a></h3>\n<p>No customers have asked for this, and it would not make too much sense to invest a lot of time in developing this, but again, since tvOS supports CloudKit, it should be fairly simple to create a version to run on the Apple TV. I would have to possibly rethink some of the interactions to make them simpler, and consider having different views for the TV. For example, it might make more sense to have the Apple TV version be a display of the score that is entered from people’s iPhones or Apple Watches. But since they would all be getting their data from the same place, this could be compelling. Maybe I could develop simple charts that show the progress of the game in a meaningful way, or simply have a fun visualization of the current status of the game. It is at least something to consider.</p>\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts-1\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>Most of the newly announced technologies in iOS 10 are not a great fit for Pointedly. One of my goals is to keep the app extremely focused and avoid letting it become bloated by trying accommodate everyone’s needs or adding features gratuitously.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whimmy\">Whimmy</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://whimmy.co/\">Whimmy</a> is an app I created together with <a href=\"http://stotion.com/\">Stotion</a> to make it easier to get together with the people that matter in your life. You can send an invite with a fuse that fills up once the capacity is reached and avoid the back-and-forth of text or email. The app is on iPhone, Apple Watch, web, and an Android beta.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sirikithttpsdeveloperapplecomsirikit-1\"><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/sirikit/\">SiriKit</a></h3>\n<p>I was so excited to hear some of the details for SiriKit because I knew it would be a great fit for Whimmy. You would not necessarily use Whimmy as your preferred messaging app to contact someone because it is more focused around events. We designed it from the beginning to streamline the process of creating and responding to invites, and integrating with Siri is a natural extension of that. My only concern is honing the experience to get all of the right information through Siri. Currently, an invite includes recipients, message, location, capacity limit, and an expiration limit. That feels like a large number of data points to capture through Siri, so we will have to see how it feels.</p>\n<p>One of the features that we have been thinking about adding to Whimmy is the ability to comment on an event. That would make for a powerful and quick interaction to use Siri to reply to an invite, or continue the conversation. Part of the challenge would be correctly identifying the correct invite for the comment from Siri, but that is something that we could hone through testing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notification-service-extensionhttpsdeveloperapplecomnotifications-1\"><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/notifications/\">Notification Service Extension</a></h3>\n<p>The ability to add custom UI to a notification when the user views the details is extremely exciting. For Whimmy, this would give us the ability to provide rich information when a recipient receives an invite, such as the people attending, potentially a map view of the location, and a visualization of the time remaining to respond. I love the challenge of figuring out how to build the designs that Stotion comes up with, and this would be another prime opportunity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"custom-notification-responseshttpsdeveloperapplecomnotifications\"><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/notifications/\">Custom Notification Responses</a></h3>\n<p>One of the demos with the advances in notifications included a user responding to an invite. The actions for the notification were: Accept, Decline, and Reply. In the Reply action, the user could send a textual reply. One of the advances this year is that in addition to the text, I could build UI to allow the user to also accept or decline the invite. This is definitely something that I want to take advantage of with Whimmy as we build the commenting feature.</p>\n<h3 id=\"imessage-apphttpsdeveloperapplecomimessage-2\"><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/imessage/\">iMessage App</a></h3>\n<p>If you already have a group message going with your friends, integrating Whimmy to create an event is a logical next step. As I mentioned earlier, we are planning to add comments to an invite, but that feature would not be needed in the context of the iMessage App version of Whimmy. You would already be chatting with your friends in Messages, and Whimmy would serve as a way for you to create an invite and easily allow your friends to respond.</p>\n<p>It could make sense to send an invite to an individual person as well through Messages. You would want to be able to send the same invite to multiple people, so you would have to be able to choose from existing invites, or to create a new one. In some ways, this could easily feel redundant. Whimmy already allows you to send invites to people, even if they are not users of the app. I think we would need to do some user research to see how people would want to use the app.</p>\n<h3 id=\"spritekithttpsdeveloperapplecomspritekit\"><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/spritekit/\">SpriteKit</a></h3>\n<p>This is not a new technology, but it is newly available on the Apple Watch, and something that I think we could take advantage of in Whimmy. With the expansion of SpriteKit to be on all iOS-based platforms (iOS, watchOS, and tvOS), this is a technology that I want to become more experienced with, even in UIKit-based apps. There are a number of animations that we use in the Apple Watch app of Whimmy, particularly in notifications, and we could convert those all to SpriteKit, and expand them to the rest of the app with good results.</p>\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts-2\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>Whimmy has not been under active development for quite some time, but the potential is huge. I love the concept and believe in the purpose of getting people together more. It also serves as a great playground for me to experiment with different technologies and push myself as a developer. It does not make sense to invest a ton of time and effort into this app, but it is one that I really enjoy working on, and plan to consider for many of the announced changes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"recite\">Recite</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://bsn.design/recite\">Recite</a> is an iOS app to facilitate memorizing scriptures, quotes, and other short passages. It is currently an iPhone app with an Apple Watch app, again with completely local data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cloudkit-sharinghttpsdeveloperapplecomicloud-1\"><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/icloud/\">CloudKit Sharing</a></h3>\n<p>This is another app for which I have wanted to add some kind of syncing. I built the app for my family to use in our morning devotional, and it has worked really well for that, as long as I am home. However, since it cannot be shared, my wife is not able to use it if I am not there, and I have wanted to fix that. So I think CloudKit Sharing will be a great fit here as well.</p>\n<p>I am currently storing content packs as downloadable in-app purchases through Apple, and have been thinking that I might change the business model a bit. If I do, the public CloudKit database might be the right place to store the data to make it easily accessible to everyone. I want to think through this more, but I feel like CloudKit will play a large role in this app moving forward.</p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>iOS 10 and watchOS 3 provide some great opportunities for me to enhance the apps that I am working on already. It is probable that I will not be able to implement all of the ideas that I have had in this post, but this has been an extremely helpful exercise for me to consider each app in turn and think through the possible implications. I look forward to mastering some of these new technologies and adding them to my toolbelt so that I am ready to make use of them as I continue to create new apps.</p>\n",

That will make it easy for a user to connect with the information and to encourage a personal approach.\n\n### [Search](https://developer.apple.com/ios/search/)\nIn iOS 9, Spotlight integration was added, and this is definitely a feature that we should take advantage of. It should be simple for a user to find their one-on-one information by searching on the phone. With the addition of app search integration into Spotlight, this becomes even more compelling. As we build search into the app, I need to make sure that we do it in a way that we can easily facilitate this powerful interaction.\n\n### [watchOS 3](http://www.apple.com/watchos-preview/)\nI have been planning on building some kind of Apple Watch app, although I am not sure exactly what the focus should be. However, with some of the changes in watchOS 3, I think the focus is much clearer. Since apps will stay “active” for eight minutes after launching them, it becomes much more feasible to have a Watch app be a reference point. If you are in a one-on-one, it could be powerful to have your agenda easily glanceable on your wrist so that you can be checking as you go to make sure that you both stay on time with the meeting, and cover everything you intended. A natural complication would be to see the next or current one-on-one, and that would make it easy to launch the app and be ready to execute the one-on-one. An implication of that interaction could be to make the agenda points completable, so that you could check them off as you go, in order to remember what is left. We will have to see where that goes.\n\n### Final Thoughts\nMany of the system-level integrations in iOS 10 are focused around location- and communication-type apps, which does not exactly fit Align. For example, it would not make sense for Align to become the preferred messaging app for communicating with someone, and so I would not want to provide that information to Contacts. I need to make sure that I appropriately tag any input fields so that I can get meaningful Quick Type suggestions for things like people, contact information, or locations. I should also take advantage of the Universal Clipboard, and make sure that I am a good citizen there. I think that is about it for Align. Good stuff!\n\n\n## Pointedly\n[Pointedly](http://bsn.design/pointedly) is actually my first app released to the App Store, and continues to be one of my favorites to work on. It is a simple app to keep score in board games, or card games, or anything else that could use tracking. In many ways, it has served the purpose of being a playground for me to try out new technologies as they make sense for the app. It is currently a stand-alone app on the iPhone with the data not synced or shared in any way.\n\n### [CloudKit Sharing](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/)\nThis is huge for me. I have been wanting to build a back-end syncing mechanism for Pointedly so that you can easily track all of your games across your devices, but I have not implemented one yet. Part of the reason was that I wanted to be able to share games, and had not decided on the easiest way to do that yet. This feature is exactly what I was hoping for in CloudKit, without even thinking of it as a possibility. I had wanted to explore different options for collaborating on a pointcard, such as having it be public, and allowing anyone to join, or sharing with an individual. From the session explaining this, I think that I can accomplish exactly what I want while keeping the data private and only shared as needed. You can either share with a specified individual, or else anyone with the link so that you could post the link in some place like Slack for anyone to join that had access. There are still a number of things that I need to think through here, like how to share the players that are involved in a game, but this is definitely the answer for me.\n\n### [iMessage App](https://developer.apple.com/imessage/)\nI am not completely sure about this yet, but I have been thinking that it would be fun to send someone a pointcard in Messages, and collaborate with them that way. It seems that there are a limited set of scenarios when this would make sense, and most of them would probably be better served by using CloudKit Sharing from within the app, but it remains an intriguing possibility. This is also a technology that I want to understand better, so in some ways I want to explore adding this just to gain experience with it.\n\n### [watchOS 3](http://www.apple.com/watchos-preview/)\nNow that Apple Watch will have directly CloudKit support, and I will probably be adding CloudKit, this makes more sense. Combined with the enhancements to keep the app running for longer, using your watch to quickly enter the score for a game feels like a great feature. The crucial thing would be to figure out how to allow for a score entry that can easily be done in under two seconds. You have to select the player and input the score in the way that makes sense and then easily get an overview of the game progress. I will have to decide about creating a pointcard, and whether to allow that on the watch, or to require the iPhone for that. It seems like it would make more sense on the iPhone, but if I can find a fast way to do it on the watch, that would be nice. Finally, I think I would definitely want to use Handoff and encourage the user to go back to the phone to share the results at the end of the game.\n\n### [tvOS 10](http://www.apple.com/tvos-preview/)\nNo customers have asked for this, and it would not make too much sense to invest a lot of time in developing this, but again, since tvOS supports CloudKit, it should be fairly simple to create a version to run on the Apple TV. I would have to possibly rethink some of the interactions to make them simpler, and consider having different views for the TV. For example, it might make more sense to have the Apple TV version be a display of the score that is entered from people’s iPhones or Apple Watches. But since they would all be getting their data from the same place, this could be compelling. Maybe I could develop simple charts that show the progress of the game in a meaningful way, or simply have a fun visualization of the current status of the game. It is at least something to consider.\n\n### Final Thoughts\nMost of the newly announced technologies in iOS 10 are not a great fit for Pointedly. One of my goals is to keep the app extremely focused and avoid letting it become bloated by trying accommodate everyone’s needs or adding features gratuitously.\n\n\n## Whimmy\n[Whimmy](http://whimmy.co/) is an app I created together with [Stotion](http://stotion.com/) to make it easier to get together with the people that matter in your life. You can send an invite with a fuse that fills up once the capacity is reached and avoid the back-and-forth of text or email. The app is on iPhone, Apple Watch, web, and an Android beta.\n\n### [SiriKit](https://developer.apple.com/sirikit/)\nI was so excited to hear some of the details for SiriKit because I knew it would be a great fit for Whimmy. You would not necessarily use Whimmy as your preferred messaging app to contact someone because it is more focused around events. We designed it from the beginning to streamline the process of creating and responding to invites, and integrating with Siri is a natural extension of that. My only concern is honing the experience to get all of the right information through Siri. Currently, an invite includes recipients, message, location, capacity limit, and an expiration limit. That feels like a large number of data points to capture through Siri, so we will have to see how it feels.\n\nOne of the features that we have been thinking about adding to Whimmy is the ability to comment on an event. That would make for a powerful and quick interaction to use Siri to reply to an invite, or continue the conversation. Part of the challenge would be correctly identifying the correct invite for the comment from Siri, but that is something that we could hone through testing.\n\n### [Notification Service Extension](https://developer.apple.com/notifications/)\nThe ability to add custom UI to a notification when the user views the details is extremely exciting. For Whimmy, this would give us the ability to provide rich information when a recipient receives an invite, such as the people attending, potentially a map view of the location, and a visualization of the time remaining to respond. I love the challenge of figuring out how to build the designs that Stotion comes up with, and this would be another prime opportunity.\n\n### [Custom Notification Responses](https://developer.apple.com/notifications/)\nOne of the demos with the advances in notifications included a user responding to an invite. The actions for the notification were: Accept, Decline, and Reply. In the Reply action, the user could send a textual reply. One of the advances this year is that in addition to the text, I could build UI to allow the user to also accept or decline the invite. This is definitely something that I want to take advantage of with Whimmy as we build the commenting feature.\n\n### [iMessage App](https://developer.apple.com/imessage/)\nIf you already have a group message going with your friends, integrating Whimmy to create an event is a logical next step. As I mentioned earlier, we are planning to add comments to an invite, but that feature would not be needed in the context of the iMessage App version of Whimmy. You would already be chatting with your friends in Messages, and Whimmy would serve as a way for you to create an invite and easily allow your friends to respond.\n\nIt could make sense to send an invite to an individual person as well through Messages. You would want to be able to send the same invite to multiple people, so you would have to be able to choose from existing invites, or to create a new one. In some ways, this could easily feel redundant. Whimmy already allows you to send invites to people, even if they are not users of the app. I think we would need to do some user research to see how people would want to use the app.\n\n### [SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/spritekit/)\nThis is not a new technology, but it is newly available on the Apple Watch, and something that I think we could take advantage of in Whimmy. With the expansion of SpriteKit to be on all iOS-based platforms (iOS, watchOS, and tvOS), this is a technology that I want to become more experienced with, even in UIKit-based apps. There are a number of animations that we use in the Apple Watch app of Whimmy, particularly in notifications, and we could convert those all to SpriteKit, and expand them to the rest of the app with good results.\n\n### Final Thoughts\nWhimmy has not been under active development for quite some time, but the potential is huge. I love the concept and believe in the purpose of getting people together more. It also serves as a great playground for me to experiment with different technologies and push myself as a developer. It does not make sense to invest a ton of time and effort into this app, but it is one that I really enjoy working on, and plan to consider for many of the announced changes.\n\n\n## Recite\n[Recite](http://bsn.design/recite) is an iOS app to facilitate memorizing scriptures, quotes, and other short passages. It is currently an iPhone app with an Apple Watch app, again with completely local data.\n\n### [CloudKit Sharing](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/)\nThis is another app for which I have wanted to add some kind of syncing. I built the app for my family to use in our morning devotional, and it has worked really well for that, as long as I am home. However, since it cannot be shared, my wife is not able to use it if I am not there, and I have wanted to fix that. So I think CloudKit Sharing will be a great fit here as well.\n\nI am currently storing content packs as downloadable in-app purchases through Apple, and have been thinking that I might change the business model a bit. If I do, the public CloudKit database might be the right place to store the data to make it easily accessible to everyone. I want to think through this more, but I feel like CloudKit will play a large role in this app moving forward.\n\n\n## Summary\niOS 10 and watchOS 3 provide some great opportunities for me to enhance the apps that I am working on already. It is probable that I will not be able to implement all of the ideas that I have had in this post, but this has been an extremely helpful exercise for me to consider each app in turn and think through the possible implications. I look forward to mastering some of these new technologies and adding them to my toolbelt so that I am ready to make use of them as I continue to create new apps.\n",

You can easily change the version number of the dependencies in Carthage, and then commit the update to the submodule, making it easy to work across teams.\n\n## Pre-requisites\n1. Create a workspace with your project included.\n\t- For help, look at [Apple&#x2019;s instructions](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-structure_navigator/articles/Creating_a_Workspace.html).\n2. Set up a Cartfile with your dependencies.\n\t- For help, look at the [Carthage documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile).\n3. In Terminal, run the command `carthage bootstrap --no-build --use-submodules`.\n\t- Make sure that you have `carthage` installed ([documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage)).\n\t- This will clone or fetch all of your dependencies, and check them out as git submodules in your project\n\t- *Note:* You only need to run `bootstrap` once in your project.

				"content_html": "<p>As I was getting my blog ready, there was a large part of me that wanted to hold back until I had something meaningful to contribute. But there was another part of me that realized that at this point, it <em>doesn’t matter</em>. When I launch my blog, no one will notice. When I write a new post, I will be the only one that will care. If there are problems, or if there is something with which I am not happy, I can change it easily, and no one else will ever know.</p>\n<p>This feeling of obscurity is simultaneously intimidating and empowering. I have already considered some of the empowering consequences, and now want to explore more of the intimidating aspects. When you know that almost no one will consume what you create, there is little incentive to deliver quickly. It can be extremely hard to build the discipline to start shipping.</p>\n<p>So how do you conquer this?</p>\n<p>One thing that I have learned in shipping my apps is that when you focus on creating something that is meaningful, people appreciate that. My first app, <a href=\"http://bsn.design/pointedly\">Pointedly</a>, was a project that was part of my path in learning iOS development.

				"content_text": "As I was getting my blog ready, there was a large part of me that wanted to hold back until I had something meaningful to contribute. But there was another part of me that realized that at this point, it _doesn’t matter_. When I launch my blog, no one will notice. When I write a new post, I will be the only one that will care. If there are problems, or if there is something with which I am not happy, I can change it easily, and no one else will ever know.\n\nThis feeling of obscurity is simultaneously intimidating and empowering. I have already considered some of the empowering consequences, and now want to explore more of the intimidating aspects. When you know that almost no one will consume what you create, there is little incentive to deliver quickly. It can be extremely hard to build the discipline to start shipping.\n\nSo how do you conquer this?\n\nOne thing that I have learned in shipping my apps is that when you focus on creating something that is meaningful, people appreciate that. My first app, [Pointedly](http://bsn.design/pointedly), was a project that was part of my path in learning iOS development. I worked on it together with my 7-year-old son, and we used it often as a family, and my wife and I made decisions together about the business side of the app. Every time that we had a trade-off between making a solid business decision for ourselves or improving the user experience, we focused on the users.

				"title": "Meeting Your Heroes",
				"content_html": "<p>We all have moments that shape our lives to take us in different directions. For some people, it might be reading a particular book; for others, it might be hearing an influential talk; and for others, it might be just meeting someone. We often don&rsquo;t realize in the moment that we are being transformed, but as we look back on our lives, it is easy to pick out those turning points. It can be dangerous when those turning points are so closely aligned with people that they become heroes to us. The danger is that they are human, and the possibility of eventual disappointment is huge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exposition\">Exposition</h2>\n<p>I work for <a href=\"http://balsamiq.com\">Balsamiq</a>, and every summer we all get together from our remote locations and have a week-long retreat. Last year it was in San Francisco, and one of our opening activities was to share a short slideshow of our heroes. One person commented that meeting your heroes can be a real let-down. He showed a slide he had made a few years earlier of his heroes, and then showed how many of them had been crossed off the list for one reason or another. One of the biggest reasons for the X’s was that he had actually met many of them, and they turned out to not be anything like what he thought.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rising-action\">Rising Action</h2>\n<p>For me, a specific turning point was the <a href=\"http://environmentsforhumans.com/2012/responsive-web-design-summit/\">RWD Summit 2012</a>, a web conference all about Responsive Web Design. I was a UX Designer on a team without front-end web developer, and was struggling to find a way to help get my designs implemented. I had no experience coding HTML or CSS to that point, and had heard the buzzwords “Responsive Web Design” thrown out, but they always seemed to mean something different each time I heard them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2018/2f4f403338.jpg\"><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2018/2f4f403338.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"08654a645942e86a4892c8a47b0b7ec2\"\n    title=\"Zoe Gillenwater Sketchnote\" \n>\n  <img src =\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2018/2f4f403338.jpg\" \n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"Zoe Gillenwater Sketchnote\" \n       \n          title=\"Zoe Gillenwater Sketchnote\"\n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</a></p>\n<p>There were two specific talks at that conference that seemed to open a door for me. The first was “Building a Responsive Layout” by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zomigi\">Zoe Gillenwater</a>. She showed how simple it was to build layouts that were not based on fixed widths, but rather on fluid percentages that could even be nested. She introduced concepts to me such as “mobile first” and “progressive enhancement” in a practical way that I could immediately see how to apply them. Because she combined solid theory with live examples, I felt like I truly understood what the foundations of responsive web design meant, and felt ready to apply them immediately in my own work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2018/1804328fc9.jpg\"><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2018/1804328fc9.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"08654a645942e86a4892c8a47b0b7ec2\"\n    title=\"Ben Callahan Sketchnote\" \n>\n  <img src =\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2018/1804328fc9.jpg\" \n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"Ben Callahan Sketchnote\" \n       \n          title=\"Ben Callahan Sketchnote\"\n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</a></p>\n<p>The second talk that struck me was “Retrofitting Sites for Responsive Web Design” by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bencallahan\">Ben Callahan</a>. He walked through the practical example of making the Twitter site responsive as we watched, using the Chrome Dev Tools. That showed me even more some of the basic properties involved in making a site responsive. I also realized that I could start playing with those tools right away to learn different CSS properties, and understand what they meant by seeing what they did when changed.</p>\n<p>That insight opened the floodgates for me. I went back to my team and started inspecting the pages after they had tried to implement my design, and I would tweak it and them email them the line number and the CSS code that I wanted changed.

				"content_text": "We all have moments that shape our lives to take us in different directions. For some people, it might be reading a particular book; for others, it might be hearing an influential talk; and for others, it might be just meeting someone. We often don't realize in the moment that we are being transformed, but as we look back on our lives, it is easy to pick out those turning points. It can be dangerous when those turning points are so closely aligned with people that they become heroes to us. The danger is that they are human, and the possibility of eventual disappointment is huge.\n\n## Exposition\nI work for [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com), and every summer we all get together from our remote locations and have a week-long retreat. Last year it was in San Francisco, and one of our opening activities was to share a short slideshow of our heroes. One person commented that meeting your heroes can be a real let-down. He showed a slide he had made a few years earlier of his heroes, and then showed how many of them had been crossed off the list for one reason or another. One of the biggest reasons for the X’s was that he had actually met many of them, and they turned out to not be anything like what he thought.\n\n## Rising Action\nFor me, a specific turning point was the [RWD Summit 2012](http://environmentsforhumans.com/2012/responsive-web-design-summit/), a web conference all about Responsive Web Design. I was a UX Designer on a team without front-end web developer, and was struggling to find a way to help get my designs implemented. I had no experience coding HTML or CSS to that point, and had heard the buzzwords “Responsive Web Design” thrown out, but they always seemed to mean something different each time I heard them.\n\n[![Zoe Gillenwater Sketchnote](https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2018/2f4f403338.jpg \"Zoe Gillenwater Sketchnote\")](https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2018/2f4f403338.jpg)\n\nThere were two specific talks at that conference that seemed to open a door for me. The first was “Building a Responsive Layout” by [Zoe Gillenwater](https://twitter.com/zomigi). She showed how simple it was to build layouts that were not based on fixed widths, but rather on fluid percentages that could even be nested. She introduced concepts to me such as “mobile first” and “progressive enhancement” in a practical way that I could immediately see how to apply them. Because she combined solid theory with live examples, I felt like I truly understood what the foundations of responsive web design meant, and felt ready to apply them immediately in my own work.\n\n[![Ben Callahan Sketchnote](https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2018/1804328fc9.jpg \"Ben Callahan Sketchnote\")](https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2018/1804328fc9.jpg)\n\nThe second talk that struck me was “Retrofitting Sites for Responsive Web Design” by [Ben Callahan](https://twitter.com/bencallahan). He walked through the practical example of making the Twitter site responsive as we watched, using the Chrome Dev Tools. That showed me even more some of the basic properties involved in making a site responsive. I also realized that I could start playing with those tools right away to learn different CSS properties, and understand what they meant by seeing what they did when changed.\n\nThat insight opened the floodgates for me. I went back to my team and started inspecting the pages after they had tried to implement my design, and I would tweak it and them email them the line number and the CSS code that I wanted changed. Eventually, I got set up to write the code from the beginning, and thus began my journey into becoming a front-end designer. Since that time, I have progressed to writing production-level code, and have been able to design and code a few sites by hand, including my own site with two different skins.\n\nFast forward to Fall 2013, and I found myself anticipating meeting the two people I hold responsible for getting me into front-end development, Zoe and Ben. The kind folks from [Environments for Humans](http://environmentsforhumans.com/) had me out to sketchnote the [CSS Dev Conference](http://2013.cssdevconf.com/) at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, and the [Artifact Conference](http://artifactconf.com/) at the Biltmore Hotel in Providence, Rhode Island.

				"content_html": "<p>I love to write. Not the novel-creating, prize-winning kind of writing, just the act of scratching a pen across paper. Growing up as a child, I wrote all kinds of things and found that I enjoyed playing with letters. My dad is something of an artist, and I always dreamed that I would be too, but that seemed to elude me. Writing though—that was something I could do. My penmanship improved in direct proportion to the number of girls that I &ldquo;fell in like&rdquo; with as I wrote each one fresh new reams of notes expressing my undying, albeit fleeting, affection.</p>\n<p>Formal education was the perfect forum to develop my love for writing. I had a different notebook for each subject, and took notes in every class. I would like to think that I also reviewed those notes at some point, but I wouldn&rsquo;t swear to that.

				"content_text": "I love to write. Not the novel-creating, prize-winning kind of writing, just the act of scratching a pen across paper. Growing up as a child, I wrote all kinds of things and found that I enjoyed playing with letters. My dad is something of an artist, and I always dreamed that I would be too, but that seemed to elude me. Writing though—that was something I could do. My penmanship improved in direct proportion to the number of girls that I \"fell in like\" with as I wrote each one fresh new reams of notes expressing my undying, albeit fleeting, affection.\n\nFormal education was the perfect forum to develop my love for writing. I had a different notebook for each subject, and took notes in every class. I would like to think that I also reviewed those notes at some point, but I wouldn't swear to that. The more I had to write, the smaller my writing got, and I felt a great sense of accomplishment at using a fraction of the paper that other people used. This wasn't due to an over-zealous eco-friendly bent, but sadly just to my pride.

Of all the things that might be required in our education system, somehow these skills were left out.\n\nI attended a parenting class taught by Kathy Andrizzi on January 27, 2012, and have been digesting it since. The class was based on the principles taught in *[The Power of Positive Parenting](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Positive-Parenting-Wonderful-Children/dp/1567131751)*, written by Kathy's uncle, Dr. Glenn Latham.\n\nI captured the event with sketchnotes and am including them here.\n\n[![Parenting Class Sketchnotes](https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/b9ed543fb9.jpg \"Parenting Class Sketchnotes\")](https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/b9ed543fb9.jpg)\n",

				"content_text": "Over the past couple months, I have been playing around in <a href=\"http://www.wordpress.com\">WordPress</a> to try and create the site that I had in my mind. I was referred to WordPress by a friend and have been thrilled with what I found. I thought I would chronicle my journey to finally creating the menu of my dreams.\n<h2>Step 1: Picture the dream</h2>\nThe first step was to create an image to upload as a header image. I knew that I wanted to eventually create a menu with fun images for each page (menu item), so I began by creating some sketches and combining them into a single image in Photoshop. The theme I was using in WordPress allowed me to upload a header image, so with a bit of fiddling, I finally got it so that the sketches lined up over the menu items. The problem was that the entire image was a big link to the home page. Through some basic usability testing, I found that everyone who used the site tried first to click on the image to get to a page, but then was taken back to the home page.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-410\" title=\"presentations design sketchnotes header\" src=\"http://benjaminsnorris.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/presentations-design-sketchnotes-header1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"101\" />\n\n<h2>Step 2: Stop the trickery</h2>\nNow I had feedback that people enjoyed the sketches, but the site wasn't terribly usable. So I set out to remove the link from the image so that if people tried to click the images, they at least wouldn't be taken to the wrong place. Fortunately, there is a great support forum for WordPress, and I was able to quickly get some help in overriding the CSS. Basically, I removed the header image through the admin console, and then put it back with the following CSS code. And, voila! A non-clickable addition to my menu items looked fun and stopped tricking people.\n\n<code>#menu {\nbackground: url(\"[benjaminsnorris.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/p...](http://benjaminsnorris.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/presentations-design-sketchnotes-header.png)\") no-repeat scroll 5px -40px transparent;\nheight: 125px;\n}</code>\n\n<code>.menu-navigation-container {\nmargin-top: 95px;\n}</code>\n<h2>Step 3: Enter the magic</h2>\nLife felt much better. My site no longer offended me, Christmas was fast approaching, and Santa had finished early. I set out to transform a static, dead menu into one that had a bit of sizzle and pop. I decided to go for the image sprite model, so I searched for some tutorials, found some great help, and then tinkered with the CSS to make it work in WordPress. Hopefully others can benefit from my short struggle.\n<h3>1. Assemble the sprite</h3>\nMy first task was to create in a single image everything that I wanted to be in the menu. I found the right font, and added the page titles underneath my little sketches. This would become the first row and would represent the menu items in a non-selected, non-rollover state.\n\nNext, I extended the canvas of my image by a factor of three (for me that meant going from 140 pixels to 420 pixels). Then I selected everything that I had created so far and duplicated it twice. I took one of the duplicates and dragged it to the very bottom, and the other went in the middle. Tis meant I ended up with three rows of my images and page titles.\n\nFinally, I got down to the real work. The final row was going to become the selected state for me, and that was going to be easier. I just wanted to change the color of the image as well as the page title. The middle row was to become the rollover state. I changed the color of the text, but the images we more complex. This needed to be fun to use, so I wanted to add a little something to each of the images. I sketched out ideas in paper with a Sharpie, and then when I had what I liked, I scanned it in, played in Photoshop until it worked with what I already had, and then I was set. That was the fun part!\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-425\" title=\"presentation design sketchnote menu\" src=\"http://benjaminsnorris.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/presentation-design-sketchnote-menu.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"350\" />\n\nIf you're trying this as well, it's important to note the size of each piece of your sprite. I already knew the height of each row, but I needed to determine the width of each menu item as well. You'll want to write down the width for each item, as you need it in the final step.\n<h3>2. Prepping the page</h3>\nSince I am using a hosted WordPress blog, the theme already handles the menu, but it can be overridden with CSS. I first needed to clear out the menu that was already being displayed as text links, and get the size of the menu right for the images I was going to use. I don't claim to be a CSS ninja, so this might not be the most elegant way to accomplish this goal, but it worked for me. I added the following lines to my CSS.\n\n<code>#menu li {\nfloat:left;\nposition:relative;\ndisplay:inline;\n}</code>\n\n<code>#menu li:hover &gt; a,#menu ul ul :hover &gt; a {\ncolor:transparent;\n}</code>\n\n<code>#menu ul li.current_page_item &gt; a,#menu ul li.current_page_ancestor &gt; a,#menu ul li.current-menu-item &gt; a {\ncolor:transparent;\n}</code>\n\n<code>#menu {\nwidth:800px;\nlist-style:none;\nheight:140px;\n}</code>\n\n<code>#menu li a {\nheight:140px;\nfloat:left;\ncolor:transparent;\n}</code>\n\n<h3>3. Putting it all together</h3>\nThe last step is to actually construct the menu in CSS. I viewed my page's source (as easy as right-clicking on the page and selecting View Page Source) in order to get the IDs of each menu time. Essentially, I had to tell the browser to show a particular piece of your sprite depending on whether the menu item is just being displayed, is selected, or is rolled-over. For each menu item, you need code in the CSS specifying which piece should be shown. Included here is the code that worked in WordPress—if you are trying this as well but using something other than WordPress the code might change slightly, but the basic idea is the same.\n\n<code>/*Specify the piece of the image that should display for the Home menu item in its normal state*/\n#menu-item-59 a {\nwidth:75px;\nbackground:url('http://benjaminsnorris.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/presentation-design-sketchnote-menu.png') no-repeat scroll 0 0 transparent;\n}</code>\n\n<code>/*When the user rolls over Home, the image should jump down to the second line*/\n#menu-item-59 a:hover {\nbackground-position:0 -140px;\n/*These are X, Y coordinates. So the image starts from 0 (the left edge), but down 140 pixels, and is going to show 75 pixels over since that is the width*/\n}</code>\n\n<code>/*And finally when Home is selected, the image should jump to the third line*/\n#menu-item-59.current-menu-item a {\nbackground-position:0 -280px;\n}</code>\n\nYou do the same thing for each menu item. The only thing that will change for each is the X coordinate for each item. It will simply be the X coordinate of the previous item minus that item's width. So, my second menu item is at -75px 0px, or 75 pixels to the right of the top left corner. My third menu item is at -200px 0px, and so on. Do that for each item, and you are set!\n\nThe finishing touch was spacing out the menu items, and making sure that only the right pieces of the image were displayed. My last bit of CSS code did just that.\n\n<code>#menu a {\nmargin:4px 6px;\npadding:0;\n}</code>\n\n<h2>Basking in the goodness</h2>\nIn the end, I was finally able to enjoy the menu I had dreamed about. Thanks to a lot of help, and a fair amount of trial and error, my sketches came to life!\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-423\" title=\"rollover header\" src=\"http://benjaminsnorris.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/rollover-header2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"101\" />\n",

This is a great way to iterate with your graphic designer as you explore the layout and basic look and feel of your site. I have seen that people look at an enhanced mockup and fill in the final polish with their minds, so it allows them to avoid fixating on a small detail that you have done differently than they were expecting. At the same time, they are able to recognize that you are close to implementing something and they can get excited about the end product.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/d9483f830e.png\"><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/d9483f830e.png\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"ce7ec64f5b8fa12f291eb8c225175a1c\"\n    title=\"Basic Home\" \n>\n  <img src =\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/d9483f830e.png\" \n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"Basic Home\" \n       \n          title=\"Basic Home\"\n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</a>\n<em>Basic Home</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/deef0b0412.png\"><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/deef0b0412.png\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"ce7ec64f5b8fa12f291eb8c225175a1c\"\n    title=\"Enhanced Home\" \n>\n  <img src =\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/deef0b0412.png\" \n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"Enhanced Home\" \n       \n          title=\"Enhanced Home\"\n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</a>\n<em>Enhanced Home</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/8e8ef0fc85.png\"><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/8e8ef0fc85.png\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"ce7ec64f5b8fa12f291eb8c225175a1c\"\n    title=\"Basic Menu\" \n>\n  <img src =\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/8e8ef0fc85.png\" \n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"Basic Menu\" \n       \n          title=\"Basic Menu\"\n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</a>\n<em>Basic Menu</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/83d60b562d.png\"><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/83d60b562d.png\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"ce7ec64f5b8fa12f291eb8c225175a1c\"\n    title=\"Enhanced Menu\" \n>\n  <img src =\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/83d60b562d.png\" \n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"Enhanced Menu\" \n       \n          title=\"Enhanced Menu\"\n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</a>\n<em>Enhanced Menu</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/b912c09dad.png\"><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/b912c09dad.png\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"ce7ec64f5b8fa12f291eb8c225175a1c\"\n    title=\"Basic Tools\" \n>\n  <img src =\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/b912c09dad.png\" \n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"Basic Tools\" \n       \n          title=\"Basic Tools\"\n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</a>\n<em>Basic Tools</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/989ecbfdad.png\"><a href=\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/989ecbfdad.png\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"ce7ec64f5b8fa12f291eb8c225175a1c\"\n    title=\"Enhanced Tools\" \n>\n  <img src =\"https://bennorris.micro.blog/uploads/2019/989ecbfdad.png\" \n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"Enhanced Tools\" \n       \n          title=\"Enhanced Tools\"\n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</a>\n<em>Enhanced Tools</em></p>\n",
